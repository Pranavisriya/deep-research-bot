{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ['# Large Language Models and Benchmarking\n\nThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has catalyzed the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which leverage deep learning techniques to understand and generate human-like text. These models have revolutionized fields such as natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and automated content generation. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into various applications, rigorous benchmarking is essential to evaluate their capabilities, performance, and ethical implications.\n\n## Background on Large Language Models\n\nLarge Language Models are advanced AI systems designed to process, generate, and understand human language. Typically built on deep learning architectures, particularly the Transformer model introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017, LLMs are trained on extensive datasets, enabling them to learn intricate patterns and contextual nuances of language. Notable examples of LLMs include OpenAI\'s GPT-3 and Google\'s BERT, which are capable of performing a range of language tasks without specific training, a phenomenon referred to as "few-shot" or "zero-shot" learning.\n\nHistorically, the development of LLMs can be traced back to foundational work in semantics and early computational models in the 19th and mid-20th centuries. The advent of deep learning techniques in the 1990s significantly improved LLM capabilities, allowing models to handle vast datasets and learn complex language structures. This evolution has been further accelerated by improvements in GPU technology, which facilitate the training of models with billions of parameters, and advancements in architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).\n\n## Importance of Benchmarking in AI\n\nBenchmarking in AI involves the systematic evaluation of models against predefined standards or datasets. It serves several critical purposes:\n\n1. **Quantifiable Performance Measurement**: Benchmarking provides a means to quantify a model\'s performance, enabling meaningful comparisons across different architectures and training methodologies. Standardized datasets, such as GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) and SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset), allow for the identification of strengths and weaknesses in model performance.\n\n2. **Guiding Research and Development**: Through benchmarking, researchers can pinpoint specific areas where models excel or underperform, informing future research directions and guiding improvements in model design. This iterative process fosters innovation and facilitates the development of more effective AI systems.\n\n3. **Ethical and Fair Deployment**: Benchmarking also plays a crucial role in addressing ethical considerations in AI. By evaluating models for biases and fairness through benchmark datasets, developers can take proactive measures to mitigate harmful effects and promote responsible AI usage.\n\n## Objectives of the Report\n\nThis report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM benchmarking, focusing on its significance, methodologies, and inherent limitations. Key objectives include:\n\n1. **Current Landscape Overview**: Analyzing the capabilities of LLMs and recent advancements in the field, including the implications of their deployment in real-world applications.\n\n2. **Benchmarking Methodologies**: Exploring the various methodologies employed in LLM evaluation, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of standardized versus custom benchmarks, and discussing the emergence of new metrics that better reflect real-world performance.\n\n3. **Understanding Implications**: Articulating the implications of benchmarking results for model deployment and societal impact, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement in evaluation practices.\n\n## Scope and Limitations\n\nWhile this report strives for comprehensiveness, it is essential to acknowledge its scope and limitations. The focus is primarily on recent advancements in LLMs and contemporary benchmarking methodologies. Historical perspectives on language models may not be extensively covered, and the discussion will center on popular benchmarks and evaluation methods, potentially omitting other existing frameworks. \n\nAdditionally, the report will address challenges in benchmarking, including the risk of overfitting to benchmark datasets and the need for benchmarks to remain relevant as models evolve. These considerations are vital for understanding the complexities and nuances of LLM evaluation.\n\n## Evolving Standards in Benchmarking\n\nThe landscape of AI benchmarking is continuously evolving, driven by advancements in technology and the increasing sophistication of AI models. Key aspects of this evolution include:\n\n1. **Emerging Metrics and Standards**: As LLMs tackle more complex and diverse tasks, benchmarks must adapt to evaluate not only traditional metrics such as accuracy and efficiency but also factors like interpretability, robustness, and fairness. This shift reflects a growing recognition of the multifaceted nature of model performance.\n\n2. **Collaborative Efforts**: Stakeholder involvement from academic institutions, industry, and regulatory bodies is crucial in standardizing benchmarking practices. Collaborative initiatives help establish consistent evaluation protocols that enhance the reliability and comparability of benchmarking results.\n\n3. **Operational Efficiency**: In practical applications, benchmarking is vital for selecting suitable models for deployment, ensuring that performance metrics align with operational requirements. Effective benchmarking can significantly influence decision-making processes in model adoption and integration.\n\n## Challenges in Benchmarking\n\nDespite its importance, benchmarking LLMs presents several challenges:\n\n1. **Bias in Evaluation**: Benchmarks may unintentionally favor models trained on specific data types or optimized for particular metrics, leading to skewed evaluations and potentially hindering the development of more generalized models.\n\n2. **Dynamic Language Nature**: The fluidity of language and rapid advancements in AI necessitate ongoing updates to benchmarking methodologies to ensure they capture the full complexity of LLM capabilities. Current benchmarks often struggle to remain relevant amid these changes.\n\n3. **Fragmentation of Initiatives**: The proliferation of various benchmarking initiatives can lead to inconsistent results and evaluations. Establishing uniform standards is essential to mitigate this fragmentation and enhance the overall integrity of benchmarking efforts.\n\nBy addressing these challenges and continuously refining benchmarking methodologies, stakeholders can ensure that evaluations remain rigorous and reflective of the evolving capabilities of Large Language Models.'], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='Background on Large Language Models overview and history'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://medium.com/@researchgraph/brief-introduction-to-the-history-of-large-language-models-llms-3c2efa517112', title='Brief Introduction to the History of Large Language Models ...', raw_content='Sign up\n\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40researchgraph%2Fbrief-introduction-to-the-history-of-large-language-models-llms-3c2efa517112&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n\nSign up\n\n[Sign in](/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40researchgraph%2Fbrief-introduction-to-the-history-of-large-language-models-llms-3c2efa517112&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png)\n\nMember-only story\n\n# Brief Introduction to the History of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\n## Understanding the Evolutionary Journey of LLMs\n\n![Research Graph](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*laJi0jBkVoGhXid7gD_DmQ.png)\n\n--\n\nShare\n\n![]()\n\nFor the open-source version of this article, please visit this [link](https://hub.researchgraph.org/brief-introduction-to-the-history-of-large-language-models-llms/).\n\n## Author\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhen we talk about large language models (LLMs), we are actually referring to a type of advanced software that can communicate in a human-like manner.

Foote   Published: December 28, 2023\n\nLarge language models are artificial neural networks (algorithms) that have gone from a recent development to widespread use within a few years. They have been instrumental in the development of ChatGPT, the next evolutionary step in artificial intelligence. Generative AI was combined with large language models to produce a smarter version of artificial intelligence.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are based on artificial neural networks, and recent improvements in deep learning have supported their development.\n\nA large language model also uses semantic technology (semantics, the semantic web, and natural language processes). The history of large language models starts with the concept of semantics, developed by the French philologist, Michel Bréal, in 1883. Bréal studied the ways languages are organized, how they change as time passes, and how words connect within a language.\n\nCurrently, semantics is used for languages developed for humans, such as Dutch or Hindi, and artificial programming languages, such as Python and Java.\n\nNatural language processing, however, is focused on translating human communications into a language understood by computers, and back again. It uses systems that can provide an understanding of human instructions, allowing computers to understand written text, recognize speech, and translate between computer and human languages.\n\n## **How Natural Language Processing Was Almost Lost Before It Started**\n\nFrom 1906 to 1912, Ferdinand de Saussure taught Indo-European linguistics, general linguistics, and Sanskrit at the University of Geneva. During this time he developed the foundation for a highly functional model of languages as systems.\n\nThen, in 1913, he died, before organizing and publishing his work.\n\nFortunately, Albert Sechehaye and Charles Bally, two instructors who were also Saussure’s colleagues, recognized the potential of his concepts and decided they were important enough to save. The two instructors collected his notes for his future manuscript, and then made the effort to gather the notes of Saussure’s students. Based on these, they wrote Saussere’s book, titled\xa0*Cours de Linguistique Générale*(translated to\xa0[*Language as a Science*](https://ia802607.us.archive.org/8/items/courseingenerall00saus/courseingenerall00saus.pdf), which eventually evolved into natural language processing (NLP), which was published in 1916.\n\n*Language as a Science*\xa0laid the foundation of the\xa0[structuralist approach](https://anthropology.ua.edu/theory/structuralism/), and later, natural language processes.\n\n## **The Need for Language Translation Jump-Starts Natural Language Processing**\n\nAfter the end of World War II (1945), the field of\xa0[natural language processing](https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-natural-language-processing-nlp/)\xa0received a great deal of attention. Peace talks and the desire for international trade prompted recognition of the importance of understanding one another and promoted the hopes of creating a machine that could translate languages, automatically.\n\nNot too surprisingly, the goal of building a language translation machine wasn’t as easy as first assumed. However, while human languages are filled with chaos and broken rules, the language of mathematics is not. Language translation machines could be adapted quite successfully to mathematics, with its unchangeable rules.\n\n## **Machine Learning and the Game of Checkers**\n\nArthur Samuel of IBM developed a computer program for\xa0[playing checkers](https://medium.com/ibm-data-ai/the-first-of-its-kind-ai-model-samuels-checkers-playing-program-1b712fa4ab96)\xa0in the early 1950s. He completed a number of algorithms that allowed his checker-playing program to improve and described it as “[machine learning](https://www.dataversity.net/machine-learning-101-2/)” in 1959.\n\n## **The Mark 1 Perceptron Uses Neural Networks**\n\nIn 1958, Frank Rosenblatt, of the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, merged Hebb’s algorithmic model of neural networks with Samuel’s work on machine learning, creating the first artificial neural network, called the Mark 1 Perceptron. Although language translation was still a goal, computers were being built primarily for mathematical purposes (much less chaotic than languages). These huge computers, built with vacuum tubes, and used as calculators, were not manufactured, but built individually, as were their software programs.\n\nThe Perceptron was also unique because it used software designed for the IBM 704, and established that similar computers could share standardized software programs.\n\nUnfortunately, the\xa0[Mark 1 Perceptron](https://blog.knoldus.com/introduction-to-perceptron-neural-network/)\xa0could not recognize many kinds of basic visual patterns (such as faces), resulting in broken expectations and cuts to neural network research and machine learning.\n\n[dv-promo buttontext=’REGISTER FOR OUR DMBOK AND CDMP PREPARATION TRAINING PROGRAM’ buttonurl=’https://training.dataversity.net/learning-paths/dmbok-and-cdmp-preparation-learning-plan?utm\\_source=dataversity&utm\\_medium=inline\\_ad&utm\\_campaign=DMBOK\\_LP\\_temp2&utm\\_content=copy1′]\n\n## **ELIZA Uses Natural Language Programming**\n\nIn 1966, an MIT computer scientist, Joseph Weizenbaum, developed ELIZA, which is described as the first program using NLP. It could identify keywords from the input it received, and respond with a pre-programmed answer.\n\nWeizenbaum was attempting to prove his assumption that the communications between humans and machines were fundamentally superficial, but things didn’t work out as planned. To simplify the experiment and minimize disputes, Weizenbaum developed a program using “[active listening](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/coaching-others-use-active-listening-skills/),” which did not require a database storing real-world information, but would reflect back a person’s statements to carry the conversation forward.\n\nHe was surprised (perhaps even horrified) that people, including Weizenbaum’s own secretary, described the computer program as having human-like feelings. Weizenbaum\xa0[wrote](https://www.filfre.net/2011/06/eliza-part-3/): “My secretary, who had watched me work on the program for many months and therefore surely knew it to be merely a computer program, started conversing with it. After only a few interactions with it, she asked me to leave the room.” He\xa0[later added](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-eliza-effect/), “I had not realized … that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.”\n\nThe original version of\xa0[ELIZA](https://sites.google.com/view/elizagen-org/the-original-eliza)\xa0recently became open-source and is available\xa0[here](https://github.com/codeanticode/eliza).\n\n## **Machine Learning Carries on as a Separate Industry**\n\nThe years between\xa0[1974 and 1980](https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-machine-learning/)\xa0are referred to as\xa0“the first AI winter.” AI researchers had to deal with two very basic limitations: small amounts of data storage and painfully slow processing speeds. Most universities had abandoned neural network research and a schism developed between AI and machine learning. Before this schism, ML was used primarily to train artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, the machine learning industry, which included several researchers and technicians, reorganized itself into a separate field. After the schism, the ML industry shifted its focus to probability theory and statistics, while continuing to work with neural networks. ML was used to answer phones and perform a variety of automated tasks.\n\n## **Small Language Models**\n\nEarly development of the first (small)\xa0[language models](http://verbit.ai/understanding-language-models-and-artificial-intelligence/)\xa0was started in the 1980s by IBM, and they were/are designed to predict the next word in a sentence. Part of their design includes a “dictionary,” which determines how often certain words occur within the text the model was trained on. After each word, the algorithm recalculates statistically what the following word should be. (This limited statistical model does not support the creativity offered by ChatGPT.)\n\n## **NLP Is combined with Machine Learning and Research Funding Returns**\n\nBy the late 1980s, computational power had increased significantly. Additionally, machine algorithms had improved and a revolution in natural language processing came about. It was the result of both the steady increase of computational power and the shift to machine learning algorithms. (Prior to the 1980s, most NLP systems used complicated, “handwritten” rules.)\n\nDuring the 1990s, the use of statistical models for NLP analyses increased dramatically because of their speed and the tremendous flow of text moving through the internet.\n\n## **The World Wide Web Provides a Massive Source of Data**\n\nTim Berners-Lee thought of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, and it was made available to the public in 1991. The World Wide Web makes it possible for large library models to access massive amounts of data for research.\n\nThe creation of the World Wide Web made the internet searchable and provided large language models with access to massive amounts of information. The [World Wide Web](https://businessdegrees.uab.edu/blog/internet-vs-world-wide-web-whats-the-difference/)\xa0offers a platform to create, store, locate, and share information on a variety of topics. During the mid-1990s, the WWW initiated new levels of use on the internet, promoting interest in online shopping and what was called “surfing” the internet.\n\n## **GPUs and Large Language Models**\n\nLarge language models require complex training, which includes the use of huge amounts of data containing billions of words and phrases. Training large language models can be described as training the individual pieces of a massive jigsaw puzzle, with each puzzle piece representing a portion of the LLM’s understanding. GPUs ([graphics processing units](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/cpu-vs-gpu)) provide a solution to these problems.\n\nA GPU is an electronic circuit that was originally designed to accelerate the processing of computer graphics and images. GPUs can process several pieces of data simultaneously, which makes them extremely useful for machine learning, gaming applications, video editing, and 3D graphics.\n\nAs the GPU’s memory capacity and speed increased, they played a significant role in developing sophisticated language models.\n\n## **Deep Learning and Large Language Models**\n\nIn the 1990s, the arrival of deep learning supported even more advanced language models. A large language model is a very large deep learning model that is pre-trained on massive amounts of data. [Deep learning](https://www.dataversity.net/brief-history-deep-learning/)\xa0is a form of machine learning, which is also a neural network, but with additional layers.\n\nIn 2011, deep learning began becoming popular. By 2018, deep learning algorithms were being used in every industry, from photography to online detail. Some of the ways deep learning applications were used include Apple’s Siri, automated drug design, and NLP for sentiment analysis.\n\n## **The Generative Adversarial Neural Network**\n\nIn 2014, Ian Goodfellow introduced the\xa0[Generative Adversarial Neural Network](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/)\xa0(a concept prompted by a conversation with friends while at a bar). The design uses two neural networks, which play against one another in a game. The game’s goal is for one of the networks to imitate a photo, tricking the opposing network into believing the imitation is real. The opposing network is looking for flaws – evidence the photo is not real. The game continues to be played until the photo is so close to perfect it tricks its opponent.\n\n## **Large Language Models Support Smarter AI**\n\nNear the end of 2022, OpenAI released\xa0ChatGPT and changed the world of AI, dramatically. They offered a powerful new chatbot capable of communicating in normal, human-like English, and able to complete a wide range of tasks, including developing new software and writing speeches.\n\n[Generative AI](https://www.dataversity.net/how-generative-ai-will-transform-business/), with the support of large language models, produced a new level of intelligent behavior in chatbots. OpenAI’s “smarter chatbots” quickly became a powerful tool useful for research, good writing, and generating realistic images or videos.\n\nA design for large language models used for the new chatbots, called OpenChatKit, was\xa0[open-sourced](https://openchatkit.net/)\xa0on March 10, 2023, by Together Computer.\n\n*Image used under license from Shutterstock*\n\nAbout the author\n\n### Keith D.

Demand for both training and inference hardware [keeps growing](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Semiconductors/Our%20Insights/Artificial%20intelligence%20hardware%20New%20opportunities%20for%20semiconductor%20companies/Artificial-intelligence-hardware.ashx). Now several years into the great AI boom, Google Scholar and arXiv’s AI and Machine Learning-focused directories continue to [receive hundreds of new submissions](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/new) on a daily basis.\n\nYet the faster the landscape expands, the more questions the industry faces — proof that an abundance of choice isn’t always a good thing. How do the latest LLMs stack up? Who has the best video generation model? Which model is the fastest with a 100k-token prompt? Last but not least: how much will it cost you?\n\n**These questions are why benchmarking matters.** From the earliest ImageNet competitions to today’s complex language and reasoning tasks, benchmarks have been the invisible engine of AI advancement. They make progress legible, drive accountability, and help researchers, businesses, and policymakers alike speak a common language.\n\n**As models have grown from narrow classifiers to multimodal, reasoning, and even agentic systems, benchmarks have had to evolve in lockstep to more closely reflect the industry’s ever-changing focus.**\n\nThis piece explores AI benchmarking’s state of affairs: why it matters, who conducts it, and the challenges and opportunities at play.\n\n## What Is AI Benchmarking?\n\nBenchmarking is the practice of evaluating an AI system’s performance against standardized tests.\n\nA benchmark might be as simple as a dataset of labeled images or as complex as an interactive software environment. **What makes it a benchmark are its consistency** — every model faces the same challenge, under the same conditions, and produces results that can be compared across time and architectures — **and its transparency.**\n\nIn machine learning’s early days, benchmarks were narrow and task-specific — think image (e.g., [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/)) or speech recognition (e.g., [TIMIT](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1)), argument extraction (e.g., [TreeBank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T42)), and so on. These benchmarks defined the early vocabulary of progress in terms of accuracy, word error rate, and [cumulative rewards](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html#key-concepts-and-terminology).\n\nIn contrast, modern benchmarks are multidimensional: they assess reasoning, safety, latency, cost, and even energy efficiency. And **as the industry comes up with new questions, it continues to require new, more sophisticated benchmarks to answer them.**\n\n## Why AI Benchmarking Matters\n\n**Benchmarks are more than technical scoreboards.** Every breakthrough in AI, from the first convolutional networks to today’s frontier models, has relied on them to **quantify improvement, validate new ideas, and facilitate reproduction**. Without shared measurement, innovation would remain siloed and anecdotal and everyone would be left guessing whether a new architecture is genuinely more capable than its predecessors, rather than simply different. By making results public and comparable, benchmarks instead enable positive feedback loops to form.\n\nAt the end of the day, benchmarking is a tool. As such, **it can be used at different stages, from research, to production, to industry-wide governance**. Let’s cover each in turn.\n\n### Research\n\nBenchmarks enable researchers in a number of ways:\n\n* They enable **comparison** through metrics rather than claims.\n* They encourage **iteration**: When experiments are run against the same test suite, labs can isolate with precision which architectural choices or training methods actually drive improvement.\n* They foster **reproducibility**: Public benchmarks turn one lab’s results into a foundation that others can build upon. Air Street Capital’s [State of AI Report 2025](https://www.stateof.ai/) highlights this dynamic clearly: standardized evaluation “turns fragmented experimentation into collective progress.”\n* They democratize **discovery** for smaller labs and independent researchers, who get access to the same insights as their deep-pocketed peers.\n\nTogether, these traits mean **innovation happens faster, for less, and spreads more widely.**\n\n### Production\n\n**Benchmarks also underpin the practical side of AI**: performance, efficiency, and cost. When you’re processing millions of requests and billions of tokens, every percentage point across any one of those metrics matters. Benchmarking allows companies big and small to access standardized measurements when deciding which hardware, model, or API endpoint to deploy.\n\nAs the space gets more crowded, **providers have put applicability front and center**. [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/), for instance, [emphasizes](https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology) that its “benchmark results are not intended to represent the maximum possible performance on any particular hardware platform, they are intended to represent the real-world performance customers experience across providers.”\n\nBenchmarking is also central to the product development process, helping developers and product teams validate their own workflows and assess their products’ performance before general availability or regulatory review. This makes internal benchmarks an indispensable complement to the external-facing tool that are user tests.\n\n### Governance and Safety\n\nFinally, benchmarks are becoming the foundation for AI governance. In recent years, **the rapid increase in the technology’s capabilities has raised concerns over the potential risks of its implementation.** Newly formed regulatory bodies are now tasked with everything from risk categorization, to defining security, transparency, and quality obligations, to conducting conformity assessments. The tracker maintained by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) — last updated in May 2025 — [shows extensive global activity](https://iapp.org/resources/article/global-ai-legislation-tracker/), with over 75 jurisdictions having introduced AI-related laws or policies to date.\n\nWith that in mind, **regulators are increasingly using benchmarks to understand what a model can do before it’s deployed**. In particular, they are interested in identifying its behavioral propensities, including a model’s tendency to hallucinate or the reliability of its performance. The UK’s [AI Security Institute (AISI)](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/), for example, runs independent evaluations of advanced models, assessing areas like biosecurity, cybersecurity, and persuasion capabilities. Its work has set a precedent for government-backed model testing, complementing internal lab efforts and introducing a form of “public audit” for AI safety.\n\n## Who Does AI Benchmarking Today?\n\nThe more central benchmarking became, the more stakeholders started getting involved in hope of **shaping the industry’s key metrics and practices**. Today, a wide range of actors provides the industry with the information it needs, including:\n\n* **Academic and non-profit initiatives**: Projects like Stanford’s [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/) (Holistic Evaluation of Language Model) and [METR](https://metr.org/) (Model Evaluation and Threat Research) drive the scientific backbone of benchmarking. HELM focuses on transparent, open, reproducible evaluations. METR, by contrast, looks at long-horizon and agentic tasks — how well models perform multi-step reasoning or sustain a plan over time.\n* **Private providers**: A segment of independent analytics and benchmarking companies has emerged to meet the growing need for consistent, business-grade comparisons. Today, providers like Artificial Analysis test commercial systems across intelligence, speed, and pricing. This professionalization of benchmarking signals a maturing market where transparent, repeatable testing becomes a service in and of itself.\n* **Internal benchmarks**: While companies widely use public, open benchmarks, they also [conduct their own testing](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ai-llama-models-training-data-ablation-2025-4). Internal benchmarking enables teams to create bespoke metrics and yardsticks before a dedicated public benchmark exists. It also supports tighter feedback loops between measurement and implementation, which can help shorten time to market. For example, at Scaleway, we use internal tests to bulletproof our PaaS solutions.\n* **Industry consortia**: The MLCommons community runs MLPerf, a leading hardware and deployment benchmark. Originally focused on training workloads, it now emphasizes inference benchmarks, including LLMs, with standardized metrics for performance per watt or dollar. MLCommons’s [board of directors](https://mlcommons.org/about-us/leadership/) includes leaders from manufacturers like Intel, Nvidia, Graphcore, and others.\n* **Safety and government evaluators**: As mentioned, AI-related legislation has spawned a number of new regulatory bodies tasked with testing frontier models for national and public safety. The UK’s AISI’s early findings have notably called for shared, cross-lab methodologies to test AI’s biosecurity, cyber, and persuasion capabilities.\n* **Crowd leaderboards**: With its intuitive chatbot interface, the [LMSYS Arena](https://lmarena.ai/) has become the public face of model comparison, allowing users to rank AI assistants through anonymous pairwise voting.\n\n**Together, these initiatives form an invaluable but increasingly complex — and sometimes contradictory — ecosystem.**\n\n## AI Benchmarking’s Challenges…\n\nEven as benchmarking becomes more sophisticated, it faces growing pains — Airstreet Capital’s [State of AI Report 2025](https://www.stateof.ai/) highlighted that the field’s rapid expansion has outpaced the robustness of its measurements. In no particular order, below are some of its current challenges.\n\n* **Data contamination and repeat exposure**: Popular benchmarks have become victims of their own success. Public datasets are widely circulated, meaning portions of test material often end up in model training data. When that happens, performance scores can reflect memory rather than reasoning, creating a false impression of progress.\n* **Variance and reproducibility**: Some reasoning and math benchmarks contain so few questions that results can swing significantly based on random seed or prompt phrasing. Without multiple runs or confidence intervals, it’s difficult to know whether performance gains are real or statistical noise.\n* **Eval-aware behavior**: The most advanced models are not just performing better; they are also starting to recognize when they’re being tested. “Eval-aware” models can change tone, verbosity, or refusal behaviors to optimize for benchmark success without improving underlying reasoning. This means evaluators may need to adopt stealthier approaches to ensure authentic behavior under evaluation. [MLPerf’s training rules](https://github.com/mlcommons/training_policies/blob/master/training_rules.adoc#mlperf-training-rules), for example, make it clear that “the framework and system should not detect and behave differently for benchmarks.”\n* **Fragmentation across evaluators**: Between private providers, non-profits, crowd sourcing, and governmental evaluators, benchmarking as a field is getting increasingly crowded. While this diversity fuels innovation, it also fragments compatibility — without a common baseline, it’s easy for models to look stronger or weaker depending on which benchmark suite is chosen. More cross-lab coordination and standardized protocols may be needed.\n* **Partial coverage**: For all the diversity in today’s benchmarking ecosystem, benchmarks still only effectively cover part of the AI. Evaluating hardware or models is essentially a solved problem; assessing processes or code architecture, not so much. Context-specific performance remains evasive — a challenge considering how companies are now trying to apply AI to increasingly specific verticals. **Now, agents represent yet another hurdle**. If agentic systems are to become the industry’s new default UI, benchmarks will need to adapt accordingly.\n* **“Tunnel vision” evaluation**: As AI regulation becomes more of a priority, benchmarking is showing its limits. Researchers from Sapienza University of Rome, DEXAI-Artificial Ethics, and Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies pointed out that current benchmarks “were not designed to measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape” — a situation they described as the [“benchmark-regulation gap.”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05464) They found that “the evaluation ecosystem dedicates the vast majority of its focus to a narrow set of behavioral propensities” while neglecting “capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios, including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI development.”\n\n## … And Opportunities\n\nWhile the above challenges need to be addressed, we should remain optimistic: positive trends are developing that should make benchmarking more useful and reliable, not less. Here are a few of them:\n\n* **Improving transparency**: Independent providers like Artificial Analysis and projects like HELP or MLPerf are setting a new bar for open methodology, releasing full prompt logs, evaluation seeds, and configuration details that allow any lab to audit and reproduce their results. These groups apply the same “open-door” approach to their blogs, publishing [full sets of questions](https://metr.org/blog/2025-06-27-risk-transparency/), responses to upcoming legislation or private frameworks, and more. Together, these efforts ensure that the culture of benchmarking leans towards openness, rather than secrecy.\n* **Positive scrutiny**: They say to solve a problem, you must first acknowledge it. Beyond pointing at structural issues, [a number](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.12990v1#S7) [of](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.06559v1) [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05464) have aimed to provide new frameworks for evaluating benchmarks — benchmarking the benchmarkers, if you will. Stanford, for instance, unveiled [BetterBench](https://betterbench.stanford.edu/), “a living repository of benchmark assessments to support benchmark comparability.” Overall, this growing (but positive) scrutiny should help improve benchmark design and usability.\n* **Future-proofing**: Long gone are the days of narrow benchmarking. With the rise of multimodal, reasoning, and now even agentic systems, providers continue to come up with new benchmarks to ensure their work reflects AI’s new capabilities and the industry’s evolving needs. Notable metrics include measuring a model’s [“task completion time horizon”](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/?) — the length of tasks AI agents can complete —, [long-term coherence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15840), or [cultural inclusivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09595). Meanwhile, practices such as periodic dataset revisions and the addition of new scenarios ensure that benchmarking remains as dynamic as the ecosystem it’s meant to monitor.\n* **Growing collaboration**: Despite stark competition for customers’ attention and spending, the industry’s various stakeholders are increasingly collaborating on shared protocols. For example, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have all participated in [joint safety evaluations under the UK’s AISI supervision](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/uk-ai-safety-research-pledge/), giving early or priority access to their models for research and safety purposes. Meanwhile, with its 125+ founding Members and Affiliates all working towards a shared goal of open industry-standard benchmarks, MLCommons stands as perhaps the best example of industry-wide collaboration.\n\nWe look forward to seeing how these developments impact the industry for the better!\n\n## Where AI Benchmarking Is Going Next\n\n**From its early, task-specific beginnings, benchmarking has evolved into vital infrastructure for the entire field of AI.** Today, the combined efforts of the public and private sectors provide the industry with continuously updated data and insights. Benchmarks enable comparison, encourage iteration, and drive discovery, ensuring that competition ultimately benefits everyone.\n\n**As the field matures, what we measure may increasingly determine what we build**. With concerns over AI safety rising, regulators are relying on benchmarking more and more for practical decision-making, while companies are turning to it for transparency and trust.\n\nAt Scaleway, benchmarking is equally central to how we operate. For example, it helps guide the roadmap for our [Generative APIs](https://www.scaleway.com/en/generative-apis/), ensuring we [integrate only battle-tested models](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/generative-apis/#whisper-large-v3-is-now-available) with proven real-world applicability.\n\nBut this relationship also flows the other way: we actively contribute to the benchmarking ecosystem. Our API inference endpoint will soon be featured on Artificial Analysis, giving researchers and businesses direct visibility into our own performance. It’s a small but meaningful step toward greater transparency — a reflection of our continued focus on transparency.\n\n  \n \n\n---\n\n   \n\n**ai-PULSE, Europe’s premier Artificial Intelligence conference powered by Scaleway, is returning!**\n\nGathering key players from across Europe, the event will be back once again at **STATION F on December 4** for a unique blend of deep technical expertise and crucial business insights.

A computer-based intelligence model is just on par with what its presentation is.\n\nIf your AI models are slow, wasteful, or inaccurate, they will not convey their regular worth. That is why benchmarking human consciousness models and execution tuning reenacted insight AI models are crucial for propelling viability and ensuring your computerized reasoning structure performs at its best.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the importance of benchmarking, key performance metrics, and effective tuning techniques to improve the speed and accuracy of [AI models](https://www.xcubelabs.com/blog/advanced-optimization-techniques-for-generative-ai-models/).\n\n## Why Benchmarking for AI Models Matters\n\nBenchmarking is the process of measuring an AI model’s performance against a standard or competitor AI model. It helps data scientists and engineers:\n\n* Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies\n* Analyze various AI models and designs\n* Set sensible assumptions for sending\n* Advance asset designation\n* Work on generally speaking precision and proficiency\n\nWithout benchmarking, you might be running an [AI model](https://www.xcubelabs.com/blog/cross-lingual-and-multilingual-generative-ai-models/) that underperforms without realizing it. Worse, you could waste valuable computing resources, leading to unnecessary costs.\n\n## Key Metrics for Benchmarking AI Models\n\nWhen benchmarking **AI models**, you should gauge explicit execution measurements for an exact appraisal. These measurements assist with determining how well the **AI models** function and whether they meet the ideal effectiveness and exactness norms. Benchmarking guarantees that your **AI models** are upgraded for genuine applications by assessing their precision, speed, asset usage, and strength.\n\nThe main ones include:\n\n### 1. Accuracy and Precision Metrics\n\n* **Accuracy:** Measures how often the AI models make correct predictions.\n* **Precision and recall measure the number of correct optimistic predictions**, while recall measures the number of actual positives captured.\n* **F1 Score:** A balance between precision and recall, often used in imbalanced datasets.\n\n### 2. Latency and Inference Time\n\n* **Induction Time:** It takes AI models to handle information and produce results.\n* **Dormancy:** The postponement of the beforehand AI models answers a solicitation fundamental for ongoing applications.\n\n### 3. Throughput\n\n* The number of deductions or forecasts a model can make each second is fundamental for applications with enormous scope, such as video handling or proposal frameworks.\n\n### 4. Computational Resource Usage\n\n* **Memory Usage:** How much RAM is required to run the model?\n* **CPU/GPU Utilization:** How efficiently the model uses processing power.\n* **Power Consumption:** This is important for AI models running on edge devices or mobile applications.\n\n### 5. Robustness and Generalization\n\n* Measures how well AI models perform on inconspicuous or boisterous information. A high-performing AI model should summarize new information well instead of simply retaining designs from the preparation set.\n\n## Performance Tuning for AI Models: Strategies for Optimization\n\nAfter benchmarking your AI models and identifying their weaknesses, the next step is fine-tuning them for improved accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. This includes changing hyperparameters, enhancing the design, refining preparing information, and executing regularization, move learning, or high-level improvement calculations. Tending to execution bottlenecks can upgrade the model’s prescient power and viability. Here are some key improvement procedures:\n\n### 1. Optimize Data Processing and Preprocessing\n\nGarbage in, garbage out. Even the best [AI model](https://www.xcubelabs.com/blog/data-augmentation-strategies-for-training-robust-generative-ai-models/) will struggle if your training data isn’t clean and well-structured. Steps to improve data processing include:  \n  \n-Taking out redundant or riotous features\n\n-Normalizing and scaling data for consistency\n\n-Using feature assurance techniques to reduce input size\n\n-Applying data extension for significant learning models\n\n### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning\n\nHyperparameters control how a model learns. Fine-tuning them can significantly impact performance. Some common hyperparameters include:\n\n* Learning Rate: Changing this can accelerate or dial back preparation.\n* Bunch Size: Bigger clumps utilize more memory yet settle preparation.\n* Number of Layers/Neurons: In profound learning AI models, tweaking design can affect exactness and speed.\n* Dropout Rate: Forestalls are overfitting by haphazardly deactivating neurons during preparation.\n\nAutomated techniques like **grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization** can help find the best hyperparameter values.\n\n### 3. Model Pruning and Quantization\n\nReducing model size without sacrificing accuracy is crucial for deployment on low-power devices. Techniques include:\n\n* **Pruning:** Removing less important neurons or layers in a [neural network](https://www.xcubelabs.com/blog/hybrid-models-combining-symbolic-ai-with-generative-neural-networks/).\n* **Quantization:** Reducing the precision of numerical computations (e.g., converting from 32-bit to 8-bit) to improve speed and efficiency.\n\n### 4. Use Optimized Frameworks and Hardware\n\nMany frameworks offer optimized libraries for faster execution:\n\n**CUDA and cuDNN** for GPU acceleration\n\n**TPUs (Tensor Processing Units)** for faster AI computations\n\n### 5. Distributed Computing and Parallelization\n\nDisseminating calculations across various GPUs or TPUs for huge-scope artificial intelligence models can accelerate preparation and induction.

They enable businesses to conduct thorough LLM evaluations, ensuring that the chosen models can meet demands for high-quality, efficient, and scalable language processing capabilities. This comprehensive evaluation process is essential for leveraging the full potential of [generative AI](/insights/ai-and-machine-learning/the-generative-ai-technology-stack) in business applications.\n\n## Challenges and limitations of LLM benchmarking\n\nOne significant challenge is the dynamic nature of language itself, which can lead to benchmarks that quickly become outdated as language use evolves. Additionally, due to the complexity and diversity of tasks that LLMs are expected to perform, no single benchmark can adequately capture a model's overall capabilities. This necessitates a suite of benchmarks to evaluate different aspects of LLM performance comprehensively.\n\nBenchmarking methodologies can also introduce biases and pitfalls that skew the evaluation of LLMs. For instance, benchmarks might favor models trained on specific types of data or those optimized for particular metrics, such as accuracy, at the expense of other important factors, like fairness or robustness. Recognizing and addressing these biases is essential for objective and reliable model comparisons. This involves designing benchmarks that are inclusive and representative of the diverse range of tasks and contexts in which LLMs operate.\n\nEnsuring fair and reliable comparisons among different LLMs requires a standardized approach to benchmarking. Variations in how models are tested and evaluated can lead to inconsistent and misleading results. Establishing common benchmarking protocols and metrics allows for more accurate comparisons, facilitating the identification of the most effective models for specific applications. This standardization is a critical step toward advancing the field of LLMs and maximizing their utility in real-world applications.\n\n## Best practices for LLM benchmarking\n\nBest practices in LLM benchmarking are vital for achieving accurate and reliable results. Carefully select benchmarks relevant to the specific tasks the LLM will perform to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the model's capabilities. Use diverse datasets to test the model across a wide range of scenarios, minimizing the risk of bias and ensuring the model's robustness and versatility.\n\nCreate standardized frameworks for LLM evaluation to significantly enhance the benchmarking process. Frameworks provide consistent guidelines for conducting benchmarks, analyzing results, and reporting findings. They facilitate comparisons across different LLMs by ensuring that all models are evaluated under the same conditions and according to the same criteria. Standardized frameworks also help with identifying areas where models excel or need improvement, guiding future development efforts.\n\nCollaboration among experts in the field is necessary for establishing and refining benchmarking standards. By pooling knowledge and resources, the [AI/ML](/insights/ai-and-machine-learning) community can develop more sophisticated and comprehensive benchmarks that accurately reflect the complexities of natural language processing tasks. This collaborative approach also promotes the sharing of best practices and innovations in LLM evaluation, driving the continuous improvement of benchmarking methodologies and the development of more advanced and capable language models.\n\n## LLM leaderboards unlock business success\n\nThe significance of LLM leaderboards extends beyond mere rankings. They serve as benchmarking tools that provide valuable insights into the capabilities and performance of various language models. By participating in open LLM leaderboards, businesses can gauge how their models stack up against the competition, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. This competitive analysis can inform strategic decisions, from refining model architectures to optimizing training datasets, ultimately enhancing the model's performance and business utility.\n\nCompanies looking to leverage generative AI technologies should understand the business benefits of participating in LLM leaderboards:\n\n* High rankings on reputable leaderboards can serve as a mark of excellence, boosting a company's reputation in the AI community and attracting potential customers, partners, and talent\n* The process of preparing for and participating in leaderboard challenges can drive internal innovation, encouraging teams to push the boundaries of what their models can achieve\n\nTo improve language model performance and rankings on LLM leaderboards, adopt a strategy of technical optimization and strategic planning.

Current benchmarks frequently focus on fine-grained code units, lack complete project context, and use inadequate evaluation metrics. To address these limitations, we introduce SWR-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 1000 manually verified Pull Requests (PRs) from GitHub, offering PR-centric review with full project context. SWR-Bench employs an objective LLM-based evaluation method that aligns strongly with human judgment (90% agreement) by verifying if issues from a structured ground truth are covered in generated reviews. Our systematic evaluation of mainstream ACR tools and LLMs on SWR-Bench reveals that current systems underperform, and ACR tools are more adept at detecting functional errors. Subsequently, we propose and validate a simple multi-review aggregation strategy that significantly boosts ACR performance, increasing F1 scores by up to 43.67%. Our contributions include the SWR-Bench benchmark, its objective evaluation method, a comprehensive study of current ACR capabilities, and an effective enhancement approach, offering valuable insights for advancing ACR research.\n\n###### Index Terms:\n\nAutomated Code Review, Large Language Models, Benchmark, Empirical Study\n\n## I Introduction\n\nCode Review (CR) is an indispensable quality assurance practice in software development\xa0[[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib1), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib2), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib3), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib4), [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib5)], aimed at identifying and rectifying potential issues in code changes before integration.

These ACR works strive to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the code review process by shortening feedback cycles, reducing the manual burden on developers, and improving the consistency and scope of reviews, thus playing a crucial role in streamlining software development workflows and maintaining high standards of code quality.\nMore recently, the explosive advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a significant shift in ACR research\xa0[[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib14), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib15), [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib16), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib17)], with a growing emphasis on LLM-based methodologies.\n\nHowever, a substantial portion of existing ACR benchmarks\xa0[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib10), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib12), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib13)] were established primarily for deep learning models that predate the widespread capabilities and sophisticated understanding of modern LLMs. This temporal and methodological gap presents challenges in evaluating the true potential of contemporary LLM-based ACR tools using these benchmarks.\nSpecifically, existing representative benchmarks\xa0[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib10), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib12), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib11), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib13)], while collecting code review data from platforms like Gerrit and GitHub, have limitations in their evaluation setups. They primarily centers its evaluation units on specific code snippets or single code modifications, rather than the complex interaction process of an entire Pull Request (PR). More critically, these benchmarks typically do not provide the complete project codebase as a necessary context for review, making it difficult for ACR tools to understand the global impact of code changes. Furthermore, the evaluation methodologies for these benchmarks are also problematic. They generally rely on traditional natural language generation metrics such as \xa0[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib10)], scores\xa0[[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib18)] and simple LLM-based ratings\xa0[[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib19), [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib20), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib15)]. However, metrics like primarily measure textual similarity, while the reliability of LLM ratings is often questioned due to potential inherent biases; both approaches have been shown to be severely inadequate in assessing whether the crucial issues are truly identified in code review comments\xa0[[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib21), [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib22)]. Furthermore, some studies\xa0[[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib14), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib9)] utilize expensive human annotation, but this approach is difficult to scale. Consequently, existing ACR benchmarks commonly exhibit several key limitations: 1) they are often detached from real-world, PR-centric review practices by focusing on overly fine-grained units instead of entire PRs; 2) they frequently lack comprehensive project context, such as the complete codebase, hindering an accurate assessment of change impact; and 3) they tend to employ inadequate evaluation metrics, such as textual similarity, simple LLM-based ratings and expensive human annotation.\n\nConsequently, evaluations on current benchmarks often misrepresent the true capabilities and practical value of LLMs in complex, real-world code review. To bridge this critical gap by constructing SWR-Bench (Software Review Benchmark), a software review benchmark designed for more realistic evaluation. Specifically, SWR-Bench comprises 1000 manually verified PR instances from GitHub open-source projects. It directly confronts the issues in existing benchmarks through its core design features:\n\n* •\n\n  PR-centric Review:\n  Each code review instance is based on a complete PR. This setup is intentionally more challenging, yet more aligned with real-world practices, as we aim to assess the ability of ACR tools to perform end-to-end code review. This includes identifying areas requiring review, pinpointing specific issues, and generating meaningful review comments.\n* •\n\n  Comprehensive Context:\n  To simulate a realistic review environment, our benchmark provides all relevant code changes (commits) and a snapshot of the entire project repository for each PR, offering comprehensive context that enables tools to accurately assess the global impact of modifications.\n* •\n\n  Objective LLM-based Evaluation:\n  We employ an automated evaluation where an LLM objectively verifies if issues from a structured ground truth report are covered in the generated review. This method offers a more objective and semantically relevant assessment than subjective “LLM-as-judge” ratings\xa0[[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib19), [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib20), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib15)] or traditional text-similarity metrics\xa0[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib10), [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib18)].\n\nAfter establishing SWR-Bench, we first validated its evaluation method, confirming strong (90%) agreement with human judgment. We then systematically evaluated mainstream ACR tools and leading LLMs on SWR-Bench, uncovering key performance aspects in realistic scenarios: 1) current tools and LLMs do not yet perform sufficiently well; 2) furthermore, we found that LLMs trained with a reasoning-focused approach exhibit better code review capabilities; and finally, 3) existing tools are more adept at detecting functional errors, such as bugs, compared to identifying non-functional issues like outdated documentation. Motivated by these observations, we further introduce a simple enhancement scheme for LLM-based automated code review. This straightforward strategy empowers an LLM to synthesize feedback from multiple review sources by analyzing, filtering valid points, and discarding erroneous suggestions to produce a superior final report. Experiments demonstrate this strategy substantially boosts ACR performance (increasing issue detection score by up to 43.67%), suggesting promising avenues for future research. Therefore, our main contributions in this work include:\n\n1. 1.\n\n   Benchmark: We introduce SWR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 1,000 real-world PRs with full project context, providing a more realistic and challenging evaluation platform for ACR systems.\n2. 2.\n\n   Evaluation Method: We developed and validated an objective LLM-based evaluation method to objectively assess ACR quality by comparing tool outputs against human ground truth.\n3. 3.\n\n   Study: We systematically assessed mainstream LLMs and ACR tools on SWR-Bench, analyzing their performance, strengths, and limitations in practical code review scenarios.\n4. 4.\n\n   Approach: We developed and validated a simple multiple review strategy that significantly improves the code review performance of ACR tools on SWR-Bench.\n\n## II Background and Related Work\n\n### II-A Modern Code Review\n\nModern Code Review (MCR) is a widely adopted quality assurance practice in contemporary software development\xa0[[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib1), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib2)], crucial for enhancing code quality, fostering knowledge sharing, and ensuring adherence to project standards. It typically involves developers submitting code changes, often through PRs, for scrutiny by their peers before integration into the main codebase.\n\nA simplified, yet representative, MCR process is depicted in Figure\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ II-A Modern Code Review ‣ II Background and Related Work ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review"). This process generally unfolds in three key stages: 1) reviewers scrutinize the code submitted in the pull request; 2) following their examination, reviewers provide a review report, identifying specific areas requiring modification, which we term “change-points”; 3) the developer then verifies these change-points and updates the PR code accordingly. We use the term ‘change’ rather than ‘fix’ or ‘defect’ because reviewer intentions often extend beyond rectifying bugs to include improvements in readability or maintainability, which may not be traditional defects. Thus, “change-points” more accurately describes the full spectrum of advised alterations\xa0[[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib23), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib24)].\n\nThe nature of these change-points varies significantly, reflecting diverse reviewer considerations\xa0[[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib23), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib24)]. Drawing from established classifications, Table\xa0[I](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S2.T1 "TABLE I ‣ II-A Modern Code Review ‣ II Background and Related Work ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review") presents a detailed taxonomy. It distinguishes between two high-level types: evolvability changes (improving future maintainability and structure) and functional changes (altering software behavior), which are further decomposed into 11 fine-grained types.\nUnderstanding these change types is fundamental to analyzing the effectiveness of both manual and automated review processes.\n\n### II-B Automatic Code Review\n\nWhile modern code review, as described above, is a vital software quality practice, manual code review faces efficiency and consistency challenges\xa0[[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib6), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib7), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib8)], motivating the development of ACR, aiming to use tools to assist or replace parts of manual review, thereby improving efficiency, shortening feedback cycles, and enhancing consistency\xa0[[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib9)].\n\nSpecifically, ACR technology has progressed through several stages. Initially, development focused on rule-based and static analysis tools, such as PMD\xa0[[25](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib25)] and SonarQube\xa0[[26](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib26)], which are effective but can be rigid and prone to false positives. Subsequently, machine learning and deep learning approaches\xa0[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib10), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib12), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib11), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib13)] emerged for tasks like code change quality assessment\xa0[[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib27), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib15), [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib28), [29](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib29), [30](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib30)], comment generation\xa0[[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib13)], and automated code repair\xa0[[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib31), [32](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib32), [33](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib33)]; while these methods can learn complex patterns, they may still struggle with deep code intent and complex contexts. More recently, large language model and AI agent-based methods\xa0[[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib14), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib15), [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib16), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib17), [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib34), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib27)], have demonstrated strong code understanding and generation capabilities, enabling more natural comments and complex reasoning. Cutting-edge work in this area, such as CodeAgent\xa0[[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib27)], explores multi-agent systems for collaborative review, while commercial tools like PR-Review\xa0[[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib28)] focus on providing targeted, actionable feedback that dynamically learns team norms, aiming to address new challenges in AI-assisted coding like feedback redundancy and unclear prioritization.\nDespite the potential of ACR, especially LLM/Agent-based methods, their real-world effectiveness in improving review quality and efficiency remains a key question. This highlights an urgent need for more effective and reliable evaluation methods and benchmarks, as current assessment approaches\xa0[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib10), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib12), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib13), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib15)] may not adequately capture the performance of these advanced models in complex, realistic code review scenarios.\n\n### II-C Code Review Benchmarks\n\nTo evaluate various ACR techniques, the research community has constructed several specialized code review benchmarks. Notable among these are a series of datasets by Tufano et al.\xa0[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib10), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib12)] and collaborators (including Trans-ReviewData\xa0[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib10)], AutoTransformData\xa0[[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib11)], T5-ReviewData\xa0[[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib12)]), and the CodeReviewer\xa0[[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib13)] dataset by Li et al.\n\nTufano et al.’s datasets\xa0[[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib10), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib12)], typically sourced from Gerrit and GitHub projects, center on method-level triplets (i.e., the submitted method, reviewer comments, and the modified method). These are used to evaluate tasks like method-level code transformation, implementing changes based on comments, and generating comments for methods. Meanwhile, those benchmarks primarily use , and \xa0[[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib35)] metrics for evaluation.\n\nThe CodeReviewer dataset\xa0[[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib13)] is also from GitHub pull requests, and its core evaluation unit is single diff hunk (i.e., contiguous modified lines). CodeReviewer supports tasks such as code change quality estimation (classifying if a diff hunk has defects), review comment generation for diff hunks, and code improvement based on comments, with metrics including classification , score, , and , while some later studies\xa0[[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib15)] also report performance using simple LLM-based ratings.\n\nWhile valuable, these benchmarks have limitations compared to real-world code review. They often lack the PR-level scope and comprehensive context (full project code, history, intent) of actual reviews, instead focusing on isolated methods or diff hunks. This hinders evaluation of an ACR tool’s ability to manage real-world complexity. Furthermore, these benchmarks predominantly rely on inadequate evaluation metrics, such as and or simple LLM-based ratings metric, which are known to correlate poorly with human judgment\xa0[[36](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib36), [37](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib37)], thus leading to potentially misleading assessments of tool efficacy.\n\nBeyond these public benchmarks, some studies\xa0[[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib14), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib9)] leverage proprietary internal data for ACR research, validating tools through manual human assessment. While such efforts provide valuable, deep insights, the private nature of this data and the prohibitive cost of manual validation make these approaches unscalable and difficult for the broader community to build upon. This leaves a clear void for a publicly available, context-rich, and scalably evaluable benchmark.\n\nConsequently, existing public benchmarks, despite their merits, often have significant limitations in scope and evaluation methodology. Evaluations based on them are unlikely to accurately gauge the practical performance of ACR tools, especially sophisticated LLM/Agent models. To this end, we introduces a benchmark focused on complete pull requests, incorporating full project context, and utilizing an objective LLM-as-judge evaluation against ground truth. This initiative seeks to provide the community with a more robust and relevant evaluation platform, thereby fostering the development of more potent ACR tools.\n\n## III SWR-Bench\n\nThis section details our methodology for constructing the automatic code review benchmark.\n\n### III-A Benchmark Construction\n\nThe overall construction workflow of SWR-Bench is depicted in Figure\xa0[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ III-A Benchmark Construction ‣ III SWR-Bench ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review") and detailed below.\n\n#### Step 1: Source Data Collection and Initial Filtering\n\nThe foundation of SWR-Bench lies in real-world software development practices.\nTo ensure authenticity and relevance, we selected 12 popular and actively maintained open-source Python projects from GitHub. These projects align with those used in the widely recognized SWE-Bench\xa0[[38](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib38)], ensuring their code quality and development practices are representative.\nWe utilized the GitHub API to crawl all historical pull requests from these projects, collecting comprehensive metadata for each PR. This included titles, descriptions, commit histories, code diffs, review comments, discussion threads, and final PR statuses (e.g., merged, closed).\nFrom this raw collection, we performed initial filtering to refine the candidate pool. We excluded PRs without any review comments, as they lack the necessary interaction for our analysis. We also removed PRs with large-scale changes (e.g., exceeding predefined thresholds for file changes or lines of code) or those with rebase operations in their commit history. This is because extensive changes make it challenging for the LLM in the subsequent verification stage to correctly identify and label the change-points. Furthermore, rebase operations make it difficult to construct reproducible environments.\nFinally, this initial filtering yielded 21,350 PRs suitable for the subsequent LLM verification phase.\n\n#### Step 2: LLM-based Change-Points Verification and Classification\n\nIn this step, we employed a LLM to identify and extract “change-points” from the filtered PRs. A change-points represents a verifiable instance where a reviewer’s suggestion led to a subsequent code modification by the developer (as described in Section\xa0[II-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S2.SS1 "II-A Modern Code Review ‣ II Background and Related Work ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")).\nWe provided the LLM with the PR’s review discussion, commit messages, and diffs, instructing it to identify instances corresponding to the 11 predefined change-point types detailed in Table\xa0[I](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S2.T1 "TABLE I ‣ II-A Modern Code Review ‣ II Background and Related Work ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review").\nTo ensure high-quality annotations, we employed Gemini-2.5-Pro\xa0[[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib39)], a state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM, for the annotation process. Beyond this, we implemented a majority voting technique, making three independent requests to the LLM for each PR to further refine the results. A PR was considered for further processing only if all three requests yielded consistent change-points extraction results; otherwise, the PR was discarded. Then, based on the LLM’s output, PRs were classified into two categories: “Change-PRs”, which contain at least one identified change-point, and “Clean-PRs”, which have no identified change-point.\n\n#### Step 3: Quality Enhancement through Filtering and Sampling\n\nTo further refine the dataset quality, we performed additional filtering and sampling.\nFirst, we applied the SZZ algorithm\xa0[[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib40)] to identify instances where issues might have been missed by human reviewers during the original PR review but were fixed later. PRs containing such missed change-points were removed. This step ensures that the change-points in our Change-PRs were all addressed during the review process itself, and that our Clean-PRs are genuinely devoid of review-relevant issues that were overlooked at the time of review.\n\nNext, to prevent ACR tools from distinguishing Change-PRs and Clean-PRs based on superficial statistical differences, we resampled Clean-PRs. This aligned their statistical properties (e.g., lines of code changed, number of commits) with those of Change-PRs, enabling a fairer assessment of ACR tools’ code understanding capabilities rather than their knack for exploiting statistical heuristics.\n\n#### Step 4: Manual Verification and Refinement\n\nAfter the preceding filtering and sampling steps, approximately 3,500 PRs remained. Given the significant effort required for manual annotation, we randomly sampled 1,000 Change-PRs and 1,000 Clean-PRs from this pool for rigorous manual verification. This manual review, conducted by five experienced graduate students majoring in computer science, and each PR was independently annotated by at least two annotators to ensure reliability. The review aimed to verify the accuracy of LLM-identified change-points in Change-PRs, ensuring they conformed to our definitions; and filter out Change-PRs containing only trivial changes (e.g., simple documentation typos, minor formatting) to focus the benchmark on more significant review interactions. This step was crucial for further enhancing the overall data quality and reliability of SWR-Bench.\n\n#### Dataset Statistics\n\nThe final SWR-Bench dataset consists of 500 Change-PRs and 500 Clean-PRs, randomly selected from manually verified and corrected PRs. This balanced composition is vital for robustly evaluating ACR tools, particularly their false positive rate, a common critique of existing automated review systems\xa0[[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib41), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib14)].\n\nEach SWR-Bench instance provides comprehensive information for ACR tools evaluation. Specifically, an instance includes: (1) the complete source data of the PR (metadata, diffs, comments), (2) ground truth change-point information for Change-PRs (including type, description, and relevant commit sha), and (3) codebase checkpoint information, allowing for the reconstruction of the full PR codebase at the relevant commit. This latter feature is particularly important for agent-based ACR tools that require an interactive environment.\n\nTable\xa0[II](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S3.T2 "TABLE II ‣ Dataset Statistics ‣ III-A Benchmark Construction ‣ III SWR-Bench ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review") presents the overall dataset statistics. We find that, on average, Change-PRs have similar numbers of modified files and lines of code compared to Clean-PRs. These similarities underscore the effectiveness of our resampling strategy (Step 3) in ensuring that Clean-PRs are not trivially distinguishable from Change-PRs based on such coarse-grained metrics.\n\nFurthermore, we analyzed change-point type distribution (Figure\xa0[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ Dataset Statistics ‣ III-A Benchmark Construction ‣ III SWR-Bench ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")). In Raw-PRs (before manual verification and filtering), functional changes (e.g., logic errors, performance issues) constituted less than 15% of all identified changes, with a predominance of more evolvability changes like documentation or style adjustments. After our manual verification process, which explicitly filtered out PRs with only trivial change-points, the proportion of functional changes in SWR-Bench increased to 31.8%. This balancing ensures that the benchmark adequately represents more critical and harder-to-detect functional issues, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of ACR tools’ capabilities.\n\n### III-B Evaluation Methodology\n\nEvaluating the output of ACR tools presents unique challenges. The report generated by a model is typically unstructured natural language text, containing various comments, or identified issues. Directly comparing this with a structured list of ground truth change-points is difficult.\nAs discussed (Section\xa0[II](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S2 "II Background and Related Work ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")), traditional text similarity metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy and practical value in code review comments\xa0[[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib21), [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib22)]. Consequently, we turn to solutions utilizing large language models as evaluation aids (LLM-as-Judge)\xa0[[37](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib37), [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib20)]. However, we also recognize that traditional LLM-as-Judge methods often rely on the LLM’s subjective judgment (e.g., scoring comment quality), which can introduce bias and inconsistency\xa0[[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib42), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib43), [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib19), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib44)]. To mitigate this, we designed an objective LLM evaluation framework that leverages ground-truth change-points referencing. Instead of subjective scoring or ranking, our LLM performs a fact-based matching task: determining if issues in the model’s report correspond to predefined ground truth change-points.\n\nOur evaluation process, depicted in Figure\xa0[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ III-B Evaluation Methodology ‣ III SWR-Bench ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review"), unfolds as follows:\n\nThe inputs to the evaluation pipeline are the code review report generated by the ACR tool and the corresponding ground truth change-points from our SWR-Bench.\nFirst, an evaluation LLM parses the ACR tool’s unstructured report to extract distinct predicted change-points. For each predicted change-point, the LLM is also prompted to determine its change-type (from 13 types in Table\xa0[I](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S2.T1 "TABLE I ‣ II-A Modern Code Review ‣ II Background and Related Work ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")) and assign a severity-score (e.g., on a scale of 1-10, from minor to critical). These latter two are subjective LLM assessments but provide useful metadata about the review report.\n\nNext, the core objective evaluation involves the LLM performing a matching task. It compares each extracted predicted change-point against the PR’s set of ground truth change-points. The LLM determines, for each ground truth change-point, whether it has been successfully “hit” (i.e., semantically identified) by one or more predicted change-points.\n\nBased on this explicit matching information, we can define TP, FP, and FN. These definitions then enable the straightforward calculation of standard performance metrics like , , and :\n\n* •\n\n  True Positives (TP): Ground-truth change-points successfully hit by at least one predicted change-point.\n* •\n\n  False Positives (FP): The number of predicted change-points that do not hit any ground truth change-point.\n* •\n\n  False Negatives (FN): The number of ground truth change-points not hit by any predicted change-points.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed in Section\xa0[III-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S3.SS1 "III-A Benchmark Construction ‣ III SWR-Bench ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review"), functional changes constitute a critical, but smaller portion of the change-points in SWR-Bench. To provide a more nuanced understanding of an ACR tool’s ability to detect these functional issues, we report performance metrics (, , and ) specifically for functional changes in addition to the overall metrics. This specialized calculation considers only predicted change-points that the evaluation LLM has typed as functional change and ground-truth change-points with functional type.\n\nIn summary, our key evaluation metrics include overall , , and for all change-points, and the specific , , and for functional change-points. We also report descriptive statistics such as the average number of predicted change-points per PR and the average LLM-assigned severity score for the predicted report. This objective, ground-truth-referenced LLM evaluation approach allows for a more accurate and in-depth assessment of ACR tools, overcoming traditional method limitations. The reliability of this evaluation approach is further validated through manual verification in later experiments.\n\n## IV Evaluation and Study\n\n### IV-A Research Questions\n\nOur study is guided by the following research questions:\n\n* •\n\n  RQ1: How reliable is the proposed evaluation methodology?\n* •\n\n  RQ2: How do mainstream automated code review tools and LLMs perform on SWR-Bench?\n* •\n\n  RQ3: How can the performance of automated code review tools be improved?\n\n### IV-B Subjects of Study\n\n#### IV-B1 Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nTo comprehensively evaluate current LLMs on ACR tasks, we selected a diverse range of models, ensuring broad representation across families, sizes, and development sources (open- and closed-source). Our selection includes closed-source LLMs like the GPT series (o3-0416, o4-mini-0416, GPT-4o-1120), Gemini series (Gemini-2.5-Pro-0325, Gemini-2.5-Flash-0427), and Claude series (Claude-3.7-Sonnet-0219, Claude-4-Sonnet-0514, Claude-4-Opus-0514). We also include open-source LLMs such as DeepSeek series (DeepSeek-R1-0120, DeepSeek-V3-0324) and Qwen2.5 series (Qwen2.5-Chat-7B/14B/32B, Qwen2.5-R1-7B/14B/32B).\nThis diverse set allows assessment across the current proprietary and public technology landscape. Importantly, by including base and reasoning-enhanced versions for some models (e.g., Qwen2.5-Chat and Qwen2.5-R1), we can preliminarily investigate if reasoning enhancements directly benefit complex code review tasks.\n\n#### IV-B2 Automated Code Review (ACR) Baselines\n\nFor a comprehensive evaluation, we also benchmark against representative open-source ACR tools and methodologies:\n\n1. 1.\n\n   LLM-Review (Simple Prompting Baseline): Our straightforward baseline directly feeds basic PR information (title, description, commit diff) via a prompt to an LLM to generate a review report, measuring baseline LLM review capabilities without specific strategies.\n2. 2.\n\n   SWR-Agent (Agent-based Baseline): Also our construction, inspired by SWE-Agent\xa0[[45](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib45)], this baseline adapts SWE-Agent’s task from program repair to code review. SWR-Agent receives PR information and uses tools to explore the codebase, execute snippets, and gather richer context for review decisions.\n3. 3.\n\n   CR-Agent\xa0[[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib27)]: A multi-agent ACR tool. In its review process, it employs two agents to detect format-related and functional related defects in a PR, respectively. The process involves inter-agent communication and debate to produce a more comprehensive code review report.\n4. 4.\n\n   Hybrid-Review\xa0[[46](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib46)]: Mirroring LLM-Review’s core, Hybrid-Review additionally feeds the LLM a static analysis report as supplementary context for a more informed review.\n5. 5.\n\n   PR-Review\xa0[[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib28)]: An open-source ACR tool from which we utilize only its component for generating code review reports. While similar to LLM-Review, PR-Review uses more sophisticated prompt engineering. Specifically, it first consolidates code diffs from multiple commits to form the input. When faced with context length limitations, it prioritizes files based on importance, potentially excluding less critical files (e.g., those with only line deletions). Finally, it instructs the LLM to output the review report in a specific structured format, categorizing suggestions into areas such as test-related defects, security-related defects, and other areas for improvement.\n\nWe acknowledge that some non-LLM models (such as earlier CodeReviewer\xa0[[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib13)] or T5-Reviewer\xa0[[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib12)]) are omitted due to their function/hunk-level focus and context limitations, making PR-level adaptation on SWR-Bench difficult. We also excluded works\xa0[[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib14)] that are not open-source, preventing consistent and reproducible evaluation. Furthermore, tools\xa0[[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib16), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib17)] requiring specific model training were also omitted, as we aim to evaluate ACR approaches that can utilize diverse leading LLMs as backends. This permits direct comparison of foundational model performance. An in-depth comparison with these types of methods, including non-LLM techniques, will be considered as future work.\n\n#### IV-B3 Experimental Setup\n\nTo ensure fair comparison, all evaluated ACR tools used their official default configurations. For two baseline we build, the inference temperature was set to 0.2.\n\n### RQ1: How reliable is the proposed evaluation methodology?\n\nTo validate the accuracy of our LLM-as-Judge evaluation methodology, we conducted a human validation experiment. Specifically, we randomly selected 100 code review reports generated in RQ2. These 100 reports were then independently annotated by three human experts and two LLMs (i.e., Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash). All five evaluators utilized the same evaluation prompt and followed the task definitions (identifying “hit” for ground truth change-points, assigning change-points type and severity scores to predicted points) as detailed in Section\xa0[III-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S3.SS2 "III-B Evaluation Methodology ‣ III SWR-Bench ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review"). We then calculated the agreement percentage among these five sets of evaluations across the 100 cases. Specifically, for discrete labels like “hit” and “change type”, agreement was counted when two evaluators provided the exact same label. For continuous severity scores (ranging from 1 to 10), agreement was established if the absolute difference between the two evaluators’ scores was 1 or less. The results are presented in three matrices: Hit-Agreement (Figure\xa0[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ RQ1: How reliable is the proposed evaluation methodology? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")a), Type-Agreement (Figure\xa0[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ RQ1: How reliable is the proposed evaluation methodology? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")b), and Severity-Agreement (Figure\xa0[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ RQ1: How reliable is the proposed evaluation methodology? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")c).\n\nAs shown in Figure\xa0[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ RQ1: How reliable is the proposed evaluation methodology? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")a, the Hit-Agreement, which is based on an objective binary criterion (hit/not hit), demonstrated substantial consistency across all five evaluators. The agreement levels between any two evaluators ranged from 89.2% to 94.9%. This high degree of concordance suggests that employing LLMs to evaluate the “Hit” aspect of code review reports is reliable and yields results largely consistent with human expert assessments. Consequently, the primary quantitative evaluation metrics in this study (i.e., overall and functional , , and ) will be calculated based on this objective “Hit” indicator.\n\nFurthermore, regarding Type-Agreement (Figure\xa0[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ RQ1: How reliable is the proposed evaluation methodology? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")b), the consistency between human experts and the LLM evaluators ranged from 69.4% to 94.8%. While this is not as uniformly high as the Hit-Agreement, it is noteworthy that the inter-human agreement also fell within a similar range from 67.4% to 83.6%. This suggests that classifying change-point types can involve a degree of inherent variability, even among human experts, potentially because some change-points may exhibit characteristics close to multiple change types, making precise categorization challenging\xa0[[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib23)]. Given that the LLM-human agreement is comparable to human-human agreement in this context, we consider this level of consistency in Type-Agreement acceptable for its use as an auxiliary metric in calculating functional , , and in our analysis.\n\nFor the agreement of“Severity Score” (Figure\xa0[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ RQ1: How reliable is the proposed evaluation methodology? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")c), which is inherently more subjective, was notably lower across all evaluator pairs, including human-human comparisons. This highlights the subjective nature of severity scoring, making it less reliable for consistent evaluation. Therefore, while severity scores are presented as supplementary information, our main conclusions are based on the objective “Hit” metric, complemented by the “Type” metric for functional analysis.\n\nUltimately, both Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash demonstrated commendable and similar agreement levels with human evaluators, particularly for the primary “Hit” metric. Given this comparable performance, and considering that a full SWR-Bench evaluation (evaluating all 1000 PRs) costs approximately $1.57 using Gemini-2.5-Flash, we select it for subsequent experiments due to its balance of strong performance and cost-effectiveness.\n\n### RQ2: How do mainstream automated code review tools and LLMs perform on SWR-Bench?\n\nIn this RQ, we first investigate the performance of studied ACR approaches on SWR-Bench, and each approaches was evaluated using three powerful LLMs, with the exception of SWR-Agent, which was not run with DeepSeek-R1 due to the latter’s lack of function call capabilities. For each ACR technique, we also report the mean performance metrics across the LLMs it was paired with. The detailed results are summarized in Table\xa0[III](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.T3 "TABLE III ‣ RQ2: How do mainstream automated code review tools and LLMs perform on SWR-Bench? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review").\n\nThe results in Table\xa0[III](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.T3 "TABLE III ‣ RQ2: How do mainstream automated code review tools and LLMs perform on SWR-Bench? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review") show that SOTA ACR techniques, when paired with SOTA LLMs, are not yet ready for real-world code review deployment based on their performance on SWR-Bench. For instance, the top-performing combination, PR-Review leveraged with Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieved an score of only 19.38%. A primary factor limiting higher scores for all techniques is their low precision, indicative of a high false positive rate. This issue is more severe for other four ACR techniques, all of which exhibited precision scores below 10%. This implies that while these ACR techniques can identify some valuable issues (or “change-points”), their overall effectiveness is severely undermined by an excessive number of false positives. Consequently, developers would need to invest considerable additional effort in verifying the validity of the generated reports, hindering practical adoption. This observation aligns with findings from previous empirical studies\xa0[[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib41)] and further validates the efficacy of SWR-Bench as a benchmark that closely mirrors realistic code review scenarios.\n\n##### Performance Analysis by ACR Tools\n\nA more granular analysis of the scores (Table\xa0[III](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.T3 "TABLE III ‣ RQ2: How do mainstream automated code review tools and LLMs perform on SWR-Bench? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")) reveals distinct performance tiers among the ACR techniques. PR-Review, which leverages meticulous prompt engineering, achieved the best overall results, securing a mean of 18.73% and a of 23.87%. Following by SWR-Agent and LLM-Reviewer, both achieving mean scores of approximately 12%. In contrast, CR-Agent, which is based on multi-agent interaction, attained a lower score of only 9.22%. This suggests that employing multi-agent systems for code review tasks is highly challenging. As noted in prior work\xa0[[47](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib47)], the interaction overhead and potential for error propagation among agents can render the task-solving process less controllable and more error-prone, ultimately leading to diminished scores. Separately, Hybrid-Review, which incorporates static analysis reports, yielded a significantly lower mean of just 4.48%. Its performance was severely hampered by exceptionally low precision, underscoring the challenge that raw static analysis outputs need more meticulous processing and careful integration to effectively enhance the ACR tools.\n\nMoreover, comparing PR-Review and LLM-Reviewer, both of which operate via a single-turn interaction with the LLM, PR-Review’s superior performance can be attributed to its more sophisticated prompt engineering, these refinements appear to significantly reduce false positives, thereby enhancing precision and, consequently, the score.\nFurther insights can be drawn from the . PR-Review reported the fewest points on average (1.49 per review), and these points also registered the highest (5.70). This indicates that PR-Review not only generates fewer suggestions but also tends to identify issues that are perceived as more critical.\n\nCollectively, these results highlight that PR-Review, with its foundation in meticulous prompt engineering, demonstrates the most promising performance among the evaluated techniques. This underscores fine-grained prompt engineering as an effective strategy for enhancing ACR capabilities. Conversely, the agent-based approaches (SWR-Agent and CR-Agent) did not yield standout results in their current form, signaling a need for further research to refine agent architectures and interaction protocols to unlock their full potential in the ACR domain.\n\n##### Performance Analysis by Change Type\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of how ACR tools handle different types of change-points, we further analyzed the average performance of PR-Review across various change types defined in \xa0[I](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S2.T1 "TABLE I ‣ II-A Modern Code Review ‣ II Background and Related Work ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review"). The results, disaggregated by change type, are shown in Table\xa0[V](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.T5 "TABLE V ‣ Performance Analysis by Change Type ‣ RQ2: How do mainstream automated code review tools and LLMs perform on SWR-Bench? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review").\n\nA key observation is that PR-Review demonstrates significantly stronger detection capabilities for functional change-points compared to evolutionary change-points. Specifically, for the F.2 Logic change, PR-Review achieved an score of 26.20%, with most functional change types also yielding scores above 21%. In stark contrast, the highest score for an evolutionary change type, E.3.1 Organization, was merely 16.45%.\n\nWe hypothesize that this disparity arises from the inherent nature of these change categories. Evolutionary changes often represent optional or stylistic improvements, where the criteria for what constitutes a necessary change can vary significantly between human reviewers\xa0[[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib23)] and LLMs. For instance, with E.3.2 Solution Approach, which was the most prevalent evolutionary change type, one human reviewer might suggest an alternative implementation they deem superior, while another might find the current approach acceptable. Consequently, accurately detecting such optional evolutionary changes presents a considerable challenge.\n\nBased on these findings, we recommend that future development of ACR tools prioritize enhancing the detection capabilities for functional changes to improve the precision for functional change-points. Furthermore, ACR tools could consider presenting reports for functional and evolutionary changes separately. Such an approach could significantly improve the usability and perceived value of automated code review reports by focusing developers’ attention on more critical and less subjective issues.\n\n##### Impact of LLMs and Reasoning Enhancement\n\nFollowing PR-Review’s superior performance, we evaluated its efficacy on SWR-Bench with diverse LLMs, including variants with and without reasoning-enhancement training (Table\xa0[IV](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.T4 "TABLE IV ‣ RQ2: How do mainstream automated code review tools and LLMs perform on SWR-Bench? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")).\n\nOverall, LLM performance with PR-Review remains suboptimal for practical code review (highest 19%). Within this context, we first noted a significant divergence: the LLM performance ranking on SWR-Bench does not consistently mirror trends observed in other SE benchmarks (e.g., SWE-Bench\xa0[[38](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib38)] and LiveCodeBench\xa0[[48](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib48)]). Claude-4-Opus and Sonnet underperformed their predecessor Claude-3.7-Sonnet on SWR-Bench. This discrepancy underscores SWR-Bench’s value in capturing unique code review challenges and speculatively points to a potential misalignment between current LLM training/optimization and code review’s specific demands, where overemphasis on other SE tasks might inadvertently reduce code review proficiency.\n\nTurning to the impact of reasoning enhancement training, we found further nuances. Models like Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1, known for their reasoning capabilities, generally performed better. The Qwen-2.5 series provided a clear illustration: its standard versions (without specific reasoning enhancement) yielded lower scores (max 13.76%). However, their reasoning-enhanced counterparts showed marked improvement. Specifically, Qwen-2.5-R1-14B achieved an of 15.95% (Qwen-2.5-R1-7B was an exception due to output formatting issues). This strongly suggests that reasoning-enhancement training is a crucial factor for improving LLM effectiveness in code review.\n\n### RQ3: How can the performance of automated code review tools be improved?\n\nWhile Conclusion 5 indicate that reasoning-enhanced LLMs perform better, the overall practical utility of current ACR approaches remains limited. This prompted a closer examination of the nature of LLM-generated reviews, particularly their reliability and consistency. Specifically, we questioned whether current LLMs provide stable and consistent feedback across different invocations or when compared to other models.\n\nTo investigate this, we conducted an analysis into the overlap of specific ground true change-points identified by different LLMs and by multiple runs of the same LLM using Venn diagrams (Figures\xa0[6(a)](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F6.sf1 "In Figure 6 ‣ RQ3: How can the performance of automated code review tools be improved? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review") and\xa0[6(b)](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F6.sf2 "In Figure 6 ‣ RQ3: How can the performance of automated code review tools be improved? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")). This analysis revealed considerable variability and instability in the sets of successfully identified defects across these models and runs. Notably, for different LLMs only 36 successfully identified change-points overlapped (Figure\xa0[6(a)](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F6.sf1 "In Figure 6 ‣ RQ3: How can the performance of automated code review tools be improved? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")), for the same LLM over five independent runs, only 27 successfully identified change-points overlapped (Figure\xa0[6(b)](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F6.sf2 "In Figure 6 ‣ RQ3: How can the performance of automated code review tools be improved? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review")). This low consistency suggests unstable detection for most change-points, implying significant randomness in LLM identification. While this variability might partly stem from the subjective nature of many evolutionary changes, it strongly indicates that LLMs’ current grasp of code review nuances may be superficial, with detections sometimes attributable to stochastic factors rather than deep comprehension.\n\nThis observed variability and the implied limitations of single-pass reviews directly motivated our exploration into whether integrating diverse review outputs could yield a more comprehensive and reliable final report. To this end, building upon PR-Review, we propose an enhanced approach named Multi-Review. The core idea is to execute PR-Review (or another ACR tool) multiple times on the same code change to generate several independent review reports. Subsequently, these reports are intelligently aggregated using an additional LLM call. This aggregation aims to: (1) improve recall by identifying high-confidence issues consistently flagged across multiple reviews, and (2) enhance precision by filtering out low-confidence or sporadically identified issues.\n\nTo validate Multi-Review’s efficacy, we conducted experiments on SWR-Bench, exploring two primary aggregation strategies: 1) Multi-Agg (aggregate results from multiple distinct LLMs) and 2) Self-Agg (employing the same LLM for multiple executions and aggregation).\n\nFigure 7: Performance of Multi-Review for varying numbers of aggregated reports ().\n\nWe selected Gemini-2.5-Flash as a representative LLM to investigate the impact of aggregating varying numbers of review reports (, where represents the baseline PR-Review without aggregation). The results, presented in Figure\xa0[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#S4.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ RQ3: How can the performance of automated code review tools be improved? ‣ IV Evaluation and Study ‣ Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Code Review"), demonstrate a significant performance uplift with Multi-Review. Regardless of whether aggregating results from different models or multiple runs of a single model, the scores showed marked improvement. Specifically, Gemini-2.5-Flash with Self-Agg () achieved an of 21.91% (a 43.67% increase) and a of 30.44% (a 118.83% increase). This larger gain in indicates Multi-Review’s effectiveness in identifying more true defects. However, to further boost the score, enhancing by reducing false positives is a key priority.\n\nTo further assess the generalizability of Multi-Review, we experimented with smaller, open-source LLMs from the Qwen-2.5 series (7B, 14B, and 32B). This was to investigate whether these models, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios, could achieve significant self-performance enhancement via Multi-Review. Indeed, Multi-Review consistently boosted scores for the Qwen series. Notably, Qwen-Chat-7B Self-Agg () improved its by 26.13% (to 14.67%), and Qwen-Chat-32B Self-Agg () enhanced its by 19.25% (to 16.41%). This performance elevation allowed their aggregated results to approach or even match the baseline PR-Review performance of some larger commercial LLMs.\n\nIn summary, our proposed Multi-Review method effectively elevates the performance ceiling of existing ACR tools by integrating diverse information and reducing review stochasticity, offering valuable insights for automated code review.\n\n## V Threats to Validity\n\nInternal Validity. Threats to internal validity mainly arise from potential bugs in our implementation and the accuracy of manual verification. To mitigate these threats, we have conducted a detailed review of the code, and our code has been made publicly available at\xa0[[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01494v1#bib.bib32)] for independent verification.\n\nExternal Validity. Threats to external validity mainly arise from the LLMs, ACR tools, and the quality of the selected projects. To mitigate these threats, we chose representative tools based on an extensive literature review and selected 12 popular, well-maintained open-source GitHub projects.\n\nConstruct Validity. The primary threat to construct validity centers on the accuracy and reliability of our objective LLM-based evaluation method. We mitigated this through human validation, which confirmed high consistency between our method’s results and human expert evaluations.\n\n## VI Conclusions\n\nThis paper addressed critical limitations in existing automated code review benchmarks by introducing SWR-Bench, a novel benchmark featuring 1,000 real-world pull requests with full project context and an objective LLM-based evaluation. Our study on SWR-Bench revealed that while current LLM-based ACR systems generally underperform, they show better aptitude for functional error detection. To improve performance, we proposed and validated a multi-review aggregation strategy that significantly boosts scores. SWR-Bench, along with our findings and proposed enhancement, provides a more realistic platform and valuable insights for advancing practical ACR research and development.\n\n## References\n\n* [1]\n\n  Z.\xa0Yang, C.\xa0Gao, Z.\xa0Guo, Z.\xa0Li, K.\xa0Liu, X.\xa0Xia, and Y.\xa0Zhou, “A survey on modern code review: Progresses, challenges and opportunities,” *CoRR*, vol. abs/2405.18216, 2024.

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ['## Overview of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative force in the field of natural language processing (NLP), fundamentally altering how machines understand and generate human language. By leveraging extensive datasets and advanced neural network architectures, particularly transformers, LLMs can perform a wide range of language-related tasks, including text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis. This section delves into a comprehensive overview of LLMs, covering their definitions, historical evolution, notable examples, and the advantages and limitations inherent in their use.\n\n### Definition of LLMs\n\nLarge Language Models are sophisticated machine learning systems designed to understand and generate human language. They typically rely on vast corpora of text data—often containing billions of words from books, articles, and web content—to learn statistical patterns and relationships between words. The architecture of LLMs predominantly utilizes deep learning techniques, with transformers being the most prevalent due to their efficiency in processing sequences of text and capturing contextual relationships.\n\nKey features of LLMs include:\n\n- **Deep Learning Structure**: Utilizing neural networks, particularly transformers, which allow for effective modeling of complex language patterns.\n- **Self-Supervised Learning**: LLMs often employ self-supervised training methods, wherein they learn from unlabelled data by tasks such as predicting masked words or the next word in a sequence.\n- **Contextual Understanding**: These models can process language in a bidirectional manner, enhancing their ability to comprehend context and nuances by considering both preceding and succeeding words.\n\n### Evolution of LLMs\n\nThe evolution of Large Language Models reflects significant milestones in both technology and methodology:\n\n1. **Early Models**: The journey of language processing began with rudimentary statistical models like n-grams, which relied on word frequency and lacked semantic understanding.\n   \n2. **Neural Network Introduction**: The introduction of neural networks in the mid-2010s, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), improved the handling of sequential data, enhancing language modeling capabilities.\n\n3. **Transformers**: The 2017 publication of the "Attention is All You Need" paper by Vaswani et al. marked a paradigm shift, introducing the transformer architecture. It employs self-attention mechanisms, allowing models to evaluate the importance of words in a sentence regardless of their position, leading to substantial improvements in performance across various NLP tasks.\n\n4. **Pre-trained Models**: The rise of transfer learning with models like ELMo and ULMFiT enabled fine-tuning on specific tasks after pre-training on large datasets, significantly reducing the need for labeled data in every application.\n\n5. **Large Scale Models**: Models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series have exemplified the capabilities of large-scale LLMs, characterized by hundreds of billions of parameters and the ability to perform diverse tasks with minimal fine-tuning.\n\n6. **Current Trends**: Recent iterations like GPT-3 and beyond illustrate the culmination of these advancements, demonstrating unprecedented scale and versatility in applications ranging from creative writing to programming assistance.\n\n### Key Examples of LLMs\n\nSeveral prominent Large Language Models have shaped the landscape of NLP, each offering unique capabilities:\n\n- **GPT-3**: Developed by OpenAI, GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter model renowned for generating human-like text. Its proficiency spans various tasks, including translation, summarization, and even coding, making it a highly versatile tool.\n\n- **BERT**: Created by Google, BERT employs a bidirectional approach to training, allowing it to capture context from both directions, which enhances its effectiveness in tasks such as sentiment analysis and question answering.\n\n- **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**: T5 adopts a novel text-to-text framework, treating all NLP tasks uniformly. This approach simplifies the training process and allows the model to be fine-tuned for a wide range of applications.\n\n- **XLNet**: Building upon BERT, XLNet combines autoregressive modeling with permutation-based training, addressing limitations in capturing long-range dependencies while enhancing bidirectional context understanding.\n\n- **RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach)**: An optimized variant of BERT, RoBERTa modifies training dynamics to enhance performance across various NLP benchmarks.\n\n### Applications in Various Domains\n\nLLMs are increasingly utilized in diverse sectors, demonstrating their flexibility and effectiveness in real-world applications:\n\n- **Customer Service**: Deployment of chatbots that engage in natural conversations with users, improving customer interaction and support.\n  \n- **Healthcare**: Assisting medical professionals with patient interactions and diagnostic support, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.\n\n- **Programming**: Aiding developers by generating code snippets or assisting in debugging processes, thereby streamlining software development.\n\n- **Research**: Supporting data analysis and summarization of findings, allowing researchers to glean insights from large volumes of text.\n\n### Advantages and Limitations of LLMs\n\n#### Advantages\n\n- **Natural Language Understanding**: LLMs excel at comprehending complex language structures, allowing for nuanced interpretation and generation of text.\n  \n- **Flexibility**: These models can be adapted to multiple tasks with minimal retraining, showcasing their versatility.\n\n- **Scalability**: The architecture of LLMs can be scaled up by increasing data and computational resources, facilitating continuous improvement and enhanced performance.\n\n#### Limitations\n\n- **Bias and Ethical Concerns**: LLMs can reflect and perpetuate biases present in their training data, leading to outputs that may reinforce harmful stereotypes.\n\n- **Resource Requirements**: The computational power and energy needed to train and deploy LLMs can be substantial, raising concerns about sustainability and environmental impact.\n\n- **Hallucination**: LLMs may produce incorrect or nonsensical information when they encounter insufficient data or context, posing challenges for reliability in critical applications.\n\nAs the field of natural language processing continues to evolve, the advancements in Large Language Models herald significant changes in how machines interact with human language, paving the way for innovative applications while also necessitating careful consideration of ethical and practical implications.'], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='Definition of large language models and their functions'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/', title='What is an LLM (large language model)? - Cloudflare', raw_content='[Sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)[Sales: +1 (888) 99 FLARE](tel:+18889935273)\n\n# What is a large language model (LLM)?\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are machine learning models that can comprehend and generate human language text.

LLMs are trained on [huge sets of data](/learning/ai/big-data/) — hence the name "large." LLMs are built on [machine learning](/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/): specifically, a type of [neural network](/learning/ai/what-is-neural-network/) called a transformer model.\n\nIn simpler terms, an LLM is a computer program that has been fed enough examples to be able to recognize and interpret human language or other types of complex data. Many LLMs are trained on data that has been gathered from the Internet — thousands or millions of gigabytes\' worth of text. Some LLMs continue to [crawl the web](/learning/bots/what-is-a-web-crawler/) for more content after they are initially trained. But the quality of the samples impacts how well LLMs will learn natural language, so an LLM\'s programmers may use a more curated data set, at least at first.\n\nLLMs use a type of machine learning called [deep learning](/learning/ai/what-is-deep-learning/) in order to understand how characters, words, and sentences function together. Deep learning involves the probabilistic analysis of unstructured data, which eventually enables the deep learning model to recognize distinctions between pieces of content without human intervention.\n\nLLMs are then further trained via tuning: they are fine-tuned or prompt-tuned to the particular task that the programmer wants them to do, such as interpreting questions and generating responses, or translating text from one language to another.\n\n## What are LLMs used for?\n\nLLMs can be trained to do a number of tasks. One of the most well-known uses is their application as [generative AI](/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/): when given a prompt or asked a question, they can produce text in reply. The publicly available LLM ChatGPT, for instance, can generate essays, poems, and other textual forms in response to user inputs.\n\nAny large, complex data set can be used to train LLMs, including programming languages. Some LLMs can help programmers write code. They can write functions upon request — or, given some code as a starting point, they can finish writing a program. LLMs may also be used in:\n\n* Sentiment analysis\n* DNA research\n* Customer service\n* [Chatbots](/learning/bots/what-is-a-chatbot/)\n* Online search\n\nExamples of real-world LLMs include ChatGPT (from OpenAI), Bard (Google), Llama (Meta), and Bing Chat (Microsoft). GitHub\'s Copilot is another example, but for coding instead of natural human language.\n\n## How do large language models work?\n\n#### Machine learning and deep learning\n\nAt a basic level, LLMs are built on machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of AI, and it refers to the practice of feeding a program large amounts of data in order to train the program how to identify features of that data without human intervention.\n\nLLMs use a type of machine learning called deep learning. Deep learning models can essentially train themselves to recognize distinctions without human intervention, although some human fine-tuning is typically necessary.\n\nDeep learning uses probability in order to "learn." For instance, in the sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog," the letters "e" and "o" are the most common, appearing four times each. From this, a deep learning model could conclude (correctly) that these characters are among the most likely to appear in English-language text.\n\nRealistically, a deep learning model cannot actually conclude anything from a single sentence. But after analyzing trillions of sentences, it could learn enough to predict how to logically finish an incomplete sentence, or even generate its own sentences.\n\n#### LLM neural networks\n\nIn order to enable this type of deep learning, LLMs are built on neural networks. Just as the human brain is constructed of neurons that connect and send signals to each other, an artificial neural network (typically shortened to "neural network") is constructed of network nodes that connect with each other. They are composed of several "layers”: an input layer, an output layer, and one or more layers in between. The layers only pass information to each other if their own outputs cross a certain threshold.\n\n#### LLM transformer models\n\nThe specific kind of neural networks used for LLMs are called transformer models. Transformer models are able to learn context — especially important for human language, which is highly context-dependent. Transformer models use a mathematical technique called self-attention to detect subtle ways that elements in a sequence relate to each other. This makes them better at understanding context than other types of machine learning. It enables them to understand, for instance, how the end of a sentence connects to the beginning, and how the sentences in a paragraph relate to each other.\n\nThis enables LLMs to interpret human language, even when that language is vague or poorly defined, arranged in combinations they have not encountered before, or contextualized in new ways. On some level they "understand" semantics in that they can associate words and concepts by their meaning, having seen them grouped together in that way millions or billions of times.\n\n## What are some advantages and limitations of LLMs?\n\nA key characteristic of LLMs is their ability to respond to unpredictable queries. A traditional computer program receives commands in its accepted syntax, or from a certain set of inputs from the user. A video game has a finite set of buttons, an application has a finite set of things a user can click or type, and a programming language is composed of precise if/then statements.\n\nBy contrast, an LLM can respond to natural human language and use data analysis to answer an unstructured question or prompt in a way that makes sense. Whereas a typical computer program would not recognize a prompt like "What are the four greatest funk bands in history?", an LLM might reply with a list of four such bands, and a reasonably cogent defense of why they are the best.\n\nIn terms of the information they provide, however, LLMs can only be as reliable as the data they ingest. If fed false information, they will give false information in response to user queries. LLMs also sometimes "[hallucinate](/learning/ai/what-are-ai-hallucinations/)": they create fake information when they are unable to produce an accurate answer. For example, in 2022 news outlet Fast Company [asked](https://www.fastcompany.com/90819887/how-to-trick-openai-chat-gpt) ChatGPT about the company Tesla\'s previous financial quarter; while ChatGPT provided a coherent news article in response, much of the information within was invented.\n\nIn terms of [security](https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/ai-secure/), user-facing applications based on LLMs are as prone to bugs as any other application. LLMs can also be manipulated via malicious inputs to provide certain types of responses over others — including responses that are dangerous or unethical. Finally, one of the [security problems with LLMs](https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/vulnerable-llm-ai/) is that users may upload secure, confidential data into them in order to increase their own productivity. But LLMs use the inputs they receive to further train their models, and they are not designed to be secure vaults; they may expose confidential data in response to queries from other users.\n\n## How developers can quickly start building their own LLMs\n\nTo build LLM applications, developers need easy access to multiple data sets, and they need places for those data sets to live. Both cloud storage and on-premises storage for these purposes may involve infrastructure investments outside the reach of developers\' budgets. Additionally, training data sets are typically stored in multiple places, but [moving that data](https://www.cloudflare.com/the-net/cloud-egress-fees-challenge-future-ai/) to a central location may result in massive [egress fees](/learning/cloud/what-are-data-egress-fees/).\n\nFortunately, Cloudflare offers several services to allow developers to quickly start spinning up LLM applications, and other types of AI. Vectorize is a globally distributed vector database for querying data stored in no-egress-fee object storage ([R2](/developer-platform/r2/)) or documents stored in [Workers Key Value](/developer-platform/workers-kv/). Combined with the development platform [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/), developers can use Cloudflare to quickly start experimenting with their own LLMs.\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\n* [Free plans](/plans/free/)\n* [Small business plans](/small-business/)\n* [For enterprises](/enterprise/)\n* [Get a recommendation](/about-your-website/)\n* [Request a demo](/plans/enterprise/demo/)\n* [Contact sales](/plans/enterprise/contact/)\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\n* [What is artificial intelligence (AI)?](/learning/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/)\n* [AI inference vs. training](/learning/ai/inference-vs-training/)\n* [History of AI](/learning/ai/history-of-ai/)\n\nMachine learning\n\n* [What is machine learning?](/learning/ai/what-is-machine-learning/)\n* [What is deep learning?](/learning/ai/what-is-deep-learning/)\n* [What is a large language model (LLM)?](/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/)\n* [Low-rank adaptation (LoRA)](/learning/ai/what-is-lora/)\n* [AI image generation](/learning/ai/ai-image-generation/)\n\nBig data\n\n* [What are embeddings?](/learning/ai/what-are-embeddings/)\n* [What is big data?](/learning/ai/big-data/)\n\n* [Vector database](/learning/ai/what-is-vector-database/)\n* [Predictive AI](/learning/ai/what-is-predictive-ai/)\n* [ChatGPT plugins](/learning/ai/chatgpt-plugins/)\n* [Neural networks](/learning/ai/what-is-neural-network/)\n* [What is generative AI?](/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/)\n* [What is natural language processing (NLP)?](/learning/ai/natural-language-processing-nlp/)\n* [AI hallucinations](/learning/ai/what-are-ai-hallucinations/)\n* [AI quantization](/learning/ai/what-is-quantization/)\n* [OWASP Top 10 for LLMs](/learning/ai/owasp-top-10-risks-for-llms/)\n* [AI data poisoning](/learning/ai/data-poisoning/)\n* [Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](/learning/ai/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/)\n* [What is agentic AI?](/learning/ai/what-is-agentic-ai/)\n* [Third wave of AI](/learning/ai/evolution-of-ai/)\n* [What is vibe coding?](/learning/ai/ai-vibe-coding/)\n* [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/learning/ai/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/)\n* [AI for cybersecurity](/learning/ai/ai-for-cybersecurity/)\n\nLearning Center\n\n* [Security Learning Center](/learning/security/what-is-web-application-security/)\n* [CDN Learning Center](/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/)\n* [DDoS Learning Center](/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/)\n* [DNS Learning Center](/learning/dns/what-is-dns/)\n* [Performance Learning Center](/learning/performance/why-site-speed-matters/)\n* [Serverless Learning Center](/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/)\n* [SSL Learning Center](/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/)\n* [Bots Learning Center](/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/)\n* [Cloud Learning Center](/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/)\n* [Access Management Learning Center](/learning/access-management/what-is-identity-and-access-management/)\n* [Network Layer Learning Center](/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-network-layer/)\n* [Privacy Learning Center](/learning/privacy/what-is-data-privacy/)\n* [Video Streaming Learning Center](/learning/video/what-is-streaming/)\n* [Email Security Learning Center](/learning/email-security/what-is-email-security/)\n* [Learning Center Home](/learning/)\n\n© 2025 Cloudflare, Inc.[Privacy Policy](/privacypolicy/)[Terms of Use](/website-terms/)[Report Security Issues](/disclosure/)[Trademark](/trademark/)'), SearchResult(url='https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models', title='What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)? - IBM', raw_content='# What are large language models (LLMs)?\n\n## Author\n\n[Cole Stryker](https://www.ibm.com/think/author/cole-stryker.html) \n\nStaff Editor, AI Models\n\nIBM Think\n\n## What are LLMs?\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are a category of [deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning) models trained on immense amounts of data, making them capable of understanding and generating natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks. LLMs are built on a type of [neural network](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks) architecture called a [transformer](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model) which excels at handling sequences of words and capturing patterns in text.\n\nLLMs work as giant statistical prediction machines that repeatedly predict the next word in a sequence. They learn patterns in their text and generate language that follows those patterns.\n\nLLMs represent a major leap in how humans interact with technology because they are the first AI system that can handle unstructured human language at scale, allowing for natural communication with machines. Where traditional search engines and and other programmed systems used algorithms to match keywords, LLMs capture deeper context, nuance and reasoning. LLMs, once trained, can adapt to many applications that involve interpreting text, like summarizing an article, debugging code or drafting a legal clause. When given agentic capabilities, LLMs can perform, with varying degrees of autonomy, various tasks that would otherwise be performed by humans.\n\nLLMs are the culmination of decades of progress in [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) (NLP) and machine learning research, and their development is largely responsible for the explosion of [artificial intelligence](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence) advancements across the late 2010s and 2020s. Popular LLMs have become household names, bringing [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai) to the forefront of the public interest. LLMs are also used widely in enterprises, with organizations investing heavily across numerous business functions and use cases.\n\nLLMs are easily accessible to the public through interfaces like Anthropic’s [Claude](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/claude-ai), Open AI’s [ChatGPT](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatgpt), Microsoft’s Copilot, Meta’s [Llama models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llama-2), and Google’s [Gemini](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/google-gemini) assistant, along with its BERT and PaLM models. IBM maintains a [Granite model series](https://www.ibm.com/granite) on [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai), which has become the generative AI backbone for other IBM products like [watsonx Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant) and [watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate).\n\nThink Newsletter\n\n### Join over 100,000 subscribers who read the latest news in tech\n\nStay up to date on the most important—and intriguing—industry trends on AI, automation, data and beyond with the Think newsletter.\xa0See the\xa0[IBM Privacy Statement](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/privacy).\n\n### Thank you!

Data scientists oversee cleaning and pre-processing to remove errors, duplication and undesirable content.\n\nThis text is broken down into smaller, machine-readable units called “tokens,” during a process of “[tokenization](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/tokenization).” Tokens are smaller units such as words, subwords or characters. This standardizes the language so rare and novel words can be handled consistently.\n\nLLMs are initially trained with [self-supervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/self-supervised-learning), a [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning?) technique that uses unlabeled data for [supervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/supervised-learning?). Self-supervised learning doesn’t require labeled datasets, but it’s closely related to supervised learning in that it optimizes performance against a "ground truth." In self-supervised learning, tasks are designed such that ground truth can be inferred from unlabeled data. Instead of being told what the “correct output” is for each input, as in supervised learning, the model tries to find patterns, structures or relationships in the data on its own.\n\n### Self-attention\n\nThe model passes the tokens through a [transformer](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model) network. Transformer models, introduced in 2017, are useful due to their [self-attention mechanism](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/attention-mechanism), which allows them to “pay attention to” different tokens at different moments. This technique is the centerpiece of the transformer and its prime innovation. Self-attention is useful in part because it allows the [AI model](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-model) to calculate the relationships and dependencies between tokens, especially ones that are distant from one another in the text. Transformer architectures also allow for parallelization, making the process much more efficient than previous methods. These qualities allowed LLMs to handle unprecedentedly large [datasets](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/dataset).\n\nOnce text is split into tokens, each token is mapped to a vector of numbers called an [embedding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/embedding). Neural networks consists of layers of artificial neurons, where each neuron performs a mathematical operation. Transformers consist of many of these layers, and at each, the embeddings are slightly adjusted, becoming richer contextual representations from layer to layer.\n\nThe goal in this process is for the model to learn semantic associations between words, so that words like “bark” and “dog” appear closer together in vector space in an essay about dogs than “bark” and “tree” would, based on the surrounding dog-related words in the essay. Transformers also add [positional encodings](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/positional-encoding), which give each token information about its place in the sequence.\n\nTo compute attention, each embedding is projected into three distinct vectors using learned weight matrices: a query, a key, and a value. The query represents what a given token is “seeking,” the key represents the information that each token contains, and the value “returns” the information from each key vector, scaled by its respective attention weight.\n\nAlignment scores are then computed as the similarity between queries and keys. These scores, once normalized into attention weights, determine how much of each value vector flows into the representation of the current token. This process allows the model to flexibly focus on relevant context while ignoring less important tokens (like “tree”).\n\n[Self-attention](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/self-attention) thus creates “weighted” connections between all tokens more efficiently than earlier architectures could. The model assigns weights to each relationship between the tokens. LLMs can have billions or trillions of these weights, which are one type of [LLM parameter](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llm-parameters), the internal configuration variables of a machine learning model that control how it processes data and makes predictions. The number of parameters refers to how many of these variables exist in a model, with some LLMs containing billions of parameters. So-called [small language models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/small-language-models) are smaller in scale and scope with comparatively few parameters, making them suitable for deployment on smaller devices or in resource-constrained environments.\n\nDuring training, the model makes predictions across millions of examples drawn from its [training data](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/training-data), and a [loss function](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/loss-function) quantifies the error of each prediction. Through an iterative cycle of making predictions and then updating model weights through [backpropagation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/backpropagation) and [gradient descent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gradient-descent), the model “learns” the the weights in the layers that produce the query, key and value vectors.\n\nOnce those weights are sufficiently optimized, they’re able to take in any token’s original [vector embedding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vector-embedding) and produce query, key and value vectors for it that, when interacting with the vectors generated for all the other tokens, will yield “better” alignment scores that in turn result in attention weights which help the model produce better outputs. The end result is a model that has learned patterns in grammar, facts, reasoning structures, writing styles and more.\n\n## Fine-tuning large language models\n\nAfter training (or in the context of additional training, “pretraining”), LLMs can be fine-tuned to make them more useful in certain contexts. For example, a foundational model trained on a large dataset of general knowledge can be fine-tuned on a corpus of legal Q&As in order to create a [chatbot](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatbots) for the legal field.\n\nHere are some of the most common forms of fine-tuning. Practitioners may use one method or a combination of several.\n\n### Supervised fine-tuning\n\nFine-tuning most often happens in a supervised context with a much smaller, labelled dataset. The model updates its weights to better match the new ground truth (in this case, labeled data).\n\nWhile pretraining is intended to give the model broad general knowledge, fine-tuning adapts a general-purpose model to specific tasks like summarization, classification or customer support. These *functional adaptations* represent new types of tasks. Supervised fine-tuning produces outputs closer to the human-provided examples, requiring far fewer resources than training from scratch.\n\nSupervised fine-tuning is also useful for *[domain-specific customization](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/domain-specific-llm)*, such as training a model on medical documents so it has the ability to answer healthcare-related questions.\n\n### Reinforcement learning from human feedback\n\nTo further refine models, data scientists often use [reinforcement learning from human feedback](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/rlhf) (RLHF), a form of fine-tuning where humans rank model outputs and the model is trained to prefer outputs that humans rank higher. RLHF is often used in alignment, a process which consists of making LLM outputs useful, safe and consistent with human values.\n\nRLHF is also particularly useful for\xa0*stylistic alignment*, where an LLM can be adjusted to respond in a way that\'s more casual, humorous or brand-consistent. Stylistic alignment involves training for the same types of tasks, but producing outputs in a specific style.\n\n### Reasoning models\n\nPurely supervised fine-tuning teaches a model to imitate examples, but it doesn’t necessarily encourage better reasoning, which involves abstract, multi-step processes. Such tasks don’t always have abundant labeled data, so [reinforcement learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reinforcement-learning) is often used in the creation of\xa0[reasoning model](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reasoning-model)s, LLMs that have been fine-tuned to break complex problems into smaller steps, often called “reasoning traces,” prior to generating a final output. Increasingly sophisticated means of training models gives them chain-of-thought reasoning and other multi-step decision-making strategies.\n\n### Instruction tuning\n\nAnother form of [LLM customization](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llm-customization) is [instruction tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/instruction-tuning), a process specifically designed to improve a model’s ability to follow human instructions. The input samples in an instruction dataset consist entirely of tasks that resemble requests users might make in their prompts; the outputs demonstrate desirable responses to those requests. Since pretrained LLMs are not inherently optimized for following instructions or conversational goals, instruction tuning is used to better align the model with user intent.\n\n## Using large language models\n\nOnce trained, large language models work by responding to prompts by tokenizing the prompt, converting it into embeddings, and using its transformer to generate text one token at a time, calculating the probabilities for all potential next tokens, and outputting the most likely one. This process, called [inference](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-inference), is repeated until the output is complete. The model does not “know” the final answer in advance; it uses all the statistical relationships it learned in training to predict one token at a time, making its best guess at every step.\n\nThe easiest and fastest way to get domain-specific knowledge from a general-purpose LLM is through [prompt engineering](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering), which does not require additional training. Users can modify prompts in all sorts of ways. For example, a prompt like “answer in the voice of a trained healthcare professional” could yield more relevant results (Note that LLMs are not recommended to be used for medical advice!).\n\nLLMs have other strategies to control their outputs, such as [LLM temperature](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llm-temperature), which controls the randomness of text that is generated by LLMs during inference, or top-k/top-p sampling, which limits the set of tokens considered to the most likely ones, balancing creativity and coherence.\n\nThe [context window](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/context-window) is the maximum number of tokens that a model can “see” and use at once when generating text. Early LLMs had short windows, but newer LLMs have hundreds of thousands of tokens in their context windows, enabling use cases like summarizing entire research papers, performing code assistance on large codebases and holding long continuous conversations with users.\n\n[Retrieval augmented generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) is a method for connecting a [pretrained model](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pretrained-model) with external knowledge bases, enabling them to deliver more relevant responses at a higher level of accuracy. The retrieved information is passed into the model’s context window, so the model can use it when generating responses, without needing retraining. For example, by connecting an LLM to a dynamic weather service database, an LLM can retrieve information for a user about that day’s weather report.\n\nAI Academy\n\n### Why foundation models are a paradigm shift for AI\n\nLearn about a new class of flexible, reusable AI models that can unlock new revenue, reduce costs and increase productivity, then use our guidebook to dive deeper.\n\n[Go to episode](https://www.ibm.com/think/videos/ai-academy/foundation-models-paradigm-shift)\n\n## Deploying LLMs\n\nBuilding an LLM from scratch is a complex and resource-intensive process. The most popular LLMs are the result of immense amounts of data, [GPUs](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpu), energy and human expertise, which is why most are built and maintained by large tech companies with expansive resources.\n\nHowever, many of these models are accessible to all developers through APIs. Developers can use [pretrained models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/pretrained-model) to build chatbots, knowledge retrieval systems, [automation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/automation) tools and more. For more control over data and customization, many open-source models can be deployed locally or in the cloud. Github, [Hugging Face](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/hugging-face), Kaggle and other platforms make AI development accessible to all.\n\nDevelopers can use LLMs as the basis for all kinds of AI applications. One of the most exciting developments in AI is the [agentic system](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai). AI agents don’t just think; they do. By themselves, LLMs simply generate text based on context, but they can be integrated with memory, [APIs](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/api), decision logic and other external systems to perform specific tasks, like booking a flight or piloting a self-driving vehicle.\n\n## Large language model use cases\n\nLLMs are redefining business processes and have proven their versatility across a myriad of use cases in many industries.\n\n* **Text generation**: LLMs can do all sorts of content creation tasks like drafting emails, blog posts or legal memos in response to prompts.\n\n* [**Text summarization**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/text-summarization): LLMs can summarize long articles, news stories, research reports, corporate documentation and customer history into thorough texts tailored in length to a desired output format and style.\n\n* [**AI assistants**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents-vs-ai-assistants): Chatbots powered by [conversational AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/conversational-ai) can perform [question answering](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/question-answering) and provide detailed information as a part of an integrated, real-time customer care solution.\n\n* [**Code generation**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/code-generator): Code assist platforms aid developers in building applications, finding errors in code and uncovering security issues in multiple programming languages, even translating between them.\n\n* [**Sentiment analysis**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/sentiment-analysis): Customer tone is analyzed in order to better understand customer feedback at scale.\n\n* **Language translation**: Automated translation provides wider coverage to organizations across languages and geographies with fluent translations and multilingual capabilities.\n* Reasoning: LLMs can solve math problems, plan multi-step processes and explain complex concepts in simpler terms.\n\n## Evaluating LLMs\n\nLLMs are powerful tools, but they come with several limitations. One major concern is accuracy. During [hallucinations](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations), the model generates information that is false or misleading while sounding plausible. LLMs can also reflect and amplify [biases](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-bias) present in their training data, producing outputs that are unfair or offensive. Additionally, their resource demands are significant: training and running LLMs requires large amounts of computational power and energy, raising both cost and environmental concerns.\n\nPractitioners can mitigate these negative aspects of LLMs through comprehensive [AI governance](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-governance), the processes, standards and guardrails that help ensure AI systems and tools are safe and ethical. A key part of governance involves evaluating models against benchmarks. [LLM benchmarks](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/llm-benchmarks) provide quantitative scores, making it easier to compare models. Because LLMs are general-purpose systems capable of a wide variety of tasks, their evaluation requires multiple dimensions rather than a single benchmark. Researchers and practitioners look at qualities like accuracy, efficiency, safety, fairness and robustness to determine how well a model performs.\n\nLLMs are also evaluated on the basis of alignment and safety, with techniques like red-teaming, where evaluators intentionally try to get the model to produce unsafe or biased responses to expose weaknesses. Fairness and bias evaluations can help practitioners prevent LLMs from reproducing harmful stereotypes or misinformation.\n\nLLMs are also commonly evaluated on the basis of efficiency. Speed, energy consumption, token throughput, memory footprint and ability to handle long context windows are some of the common metrics used to evaluate how efficiently LLMs are able to arrive at outputs.\n\n## A short history of LLMs\n\nThe history of LLMs goes back to the early days of computing and natural language processing, when researchers used rule-based systems and statistical methods to model text. These early approaches could capture local word patterns but failed to understand long-range dependencies or deeper semantics.\n\nA major shift came in the 2010s with the rise of neural networks, with word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe, which represented words as vectors in continuous space, enabling models to learn semantic relationships. Sequence models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks emerged to better handle sequential data.\n\nIn 2017, Vaswani *et al.* introduced the [encoder–decoder](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/encoder-decoder-model) transformer architecture in the landmark paper “Attention Is All You Need.”[1] Transformers made it possible to train models on large datasets, marking the beginning of the modern LLM era. Google’s BERT (2018), an encoder-only transformer, demonstrated the power of transformers for understanding language, while OpenAI’s generative pretrained transformer (GPT) series, based on a decoder-only variant, showed how generative pretraining on internet-scale text could yield remarkably fluent language generation. Around the same time, encoder–decoder models like Google’s T5 and Facebook’s BART showcased the strengths of the full sequence-to-sequence design for tasks such as translation and summarization. GPT-2 (2019) attracted attention for its ability to generate coherent paragraphs, while GPT-3 (2020), with 175 billion parameters, cemented LLMs as a transformative force in AI.\n\nIn addition, new architectures are challenging transformers’ popularity in LLMs. [Mamba models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mamba-model) work by using a state-space model with selective updates that efficiently filter and combine past information, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies. [Diffusion LLMs](https://www.ibm.com/think/news/diffusion-models-llms) start with random noise and gradually denoise it step by step, guided by a learned model, until coherent text emerges. Both architectures can be much more efficient than transformers.\n\n[Ebook   How to choose the right foundation model \n\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\n\n Read the ebook](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52620)\n\n## Resources\n\n[AI models   Explore IBM Granite \n\nDiscover IBM® Granite™, our family of open, performant and trusted AI models, tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

As LLMs train on large amounts of text, they learn to predict the next word, or sequence of words, based on the context provided through a prompt—they can even mimic the writing style of a particular author or genre.\n\nLLMs burst out of labs and into public consciousness in the early 2020s. Since then, thanks to their impressive ability to interpret requests and produce relevant responses, they’ve become both standalone products and value-added capabilities embedded in business software, providing natural language processing, machine translation, content generation, chatbots, document summarization, and more.\n\nThis technology continues to rapidly evolve, incorporating larger data sets and adding layers of training and tuning to make the models perform better. Broader and deeper training, made possible by ever-more powerful compute infrastructure, is yielding increasingly sophisticated reasoning capabilities that can be put to work generating plans to achieve organizational goals. These reasoning capabilities also underpin the functionality of AI agents, which use advanced LLMs to complete tasks that human operators set out for them.\n\n## What Are Large Language Models?\n\nLarge language models are [artificial intelligence systems](/artificial-intelligence/what-is-ai/) that have been trained on vast data sets, often consisting of billions of words taken from books, the web, and other sources, to generate human-like, contextually relevant responses to queries. Because LLMs are designed to understand questions—or “prompts” in LLM terminology—and generate natural language responses, they can perform tasks such as answering customer questions, summarizing information in reports, translating between languages, and composing poetry, computer code, and first drafts of emails. LLMs typically have a sophisticated understanding of the grammar and semantics of the languages in which they’re trained. They can be configured to use an organization’s own data to provide responses that are unique to the organization.\n\nDespite these impressive capabilities, users should be mindful of the limitations of LLMs. Outdated data and poorly worded prompts can result in mistakes, such as a chatbot giving a wrong answer about a company’s products. A lack of sufficient data can cause LLMs to make up answers, or “hallucinate.” And while LLMs are great at prediction, historically they have done a poor job explaining how they came to a given conclusion. These are some of the areas newer LLMs seek to improve on.\n\nStill, LLMs mark a significant advance in the [field of natural language processing](/artificial-intelligence/what-is-natural-language-processing/). Business uses abound—new applications are rapidly being developed and adopted.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* Large language models are state-of-the-art in the field of natural language processing and are also being applied to develop multimodal AI that can generate audio and images.\n* "Large" is a relative term that refers to the number of parameters the model evaluates when determining the output for any given prompt.\n* LLMs shot to prominence in 2022 with the release of ChatGPT, an application that made OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model available to the general public. Other popular models include Llama, Gemini, and Cohere Command R.\n\n## Large Language Models Explained\n\nNatural language processing has been an active area of artificial intelligence research since the 1960s, and early language models go back decades. Large language models propelled the field forward by [employing deep learning](/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/what-is-deep-learning/), which layers [machine learning](/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/) on neural networks to yield more sophisticated models. Another characteristic of LLMs is that training of the foundation model is conducted without human intervention in the form of labeling data, a process called self-supervised learning.\n\nThe modern conception of an LLM was born in 2017 with a seminal paper from Google that described a powerful new architecture called transformer networks. Transformers applied a self-attention mechanism that enabled parallel processing, which sped up and lowered the cost of both training and deploying the models. OpenAI applied this architecture to create GPT-1, which many consider the first modern LLM.\n\nEnterprises took notice—they’re rapidly discovering that LLMs can underpin a myriad of use cases and offer enormous potential to help make their businesses more productive, efficient, and responsive to customers.\n\n## LLMs vs. Other AI Models: Efficiency and Scalability\n\nLLMs are one of many types of AI developed through the process of machine learning. There are a few elements, however, that define and distinguish these models. Foremost is their size. The “large” in LLM refers to the number of parameters that compute a final output, as well as the amount of data that goes into training the model by adjusting those parameters.\n\n* **Size and Performance**: LLMs are defined by model size, which reflects the number of parameters that determine their outputs. The leading models have become exponentially larger in only a few years: GPT-1 had just over 100 million parameters; its most-recent successor, GPT-4, is speculated to have more than 1.75 trillion, though OpenAI hasn’t disclosed its true size.  \n     \n   Typically, the greater the size of the model and the more extensive its training set, the better it performs in generating unique, relevant responses that adeptly mimic human comprehension and language generation capabilities. Performance can be measured by perplexity, a metric that quantifies how confident the model is when it predicts the next word in its output sequence.  \n     \n   Larger models generally yield superior performance, but not in every way. Their potential drawbacks can include higher latency—the time it takes the model to come up with an answer to a prompt—and difficulty scaling because of the compute infrastructure they require. They’re also trickier to customize for specific enterprise use cases. For that reason, there are notable efforts to develop smaller LLMs that are more economical to deploy while still performing well, at least within more limited domains and use cases.\n* **Scalability and Deployment**: LLMs can be deployed in a few different ways. Commercial vendors, such as OpenAI, Google, and Cohere, make their models available through hosted services via a browser, app, or API calls. Many enterprises, however, prefer to host their own LLMs, usually foundation models that have been [fine-tuned](/artificial-intelligence/fine-tune-llms/) or augmented with proprietary business data, or both, on local servers or in their public cloud environments, where they run the inference phase of executing the models. Individuals and software then interact with them by direct calls or through API endpoints.  \n     \n   Regardless of the deployment method, LLMs—especially those that can be accessed by the general public or a large workforce—need to be able to scale to fulfill expected demand without busting an enterprise budget. The economics of this scaling involve tradeoffs. Measures that can improve scalability, such as more-powerful inference infrastructure, distributed computing, and effective load balancing and caching, all come at a cost. Failures to strike the correct cost-benefit balance can result in latency that compromises the ability to run applications in real time, inconsistent performance, slow uptake by the workforce, and inadequate data privacy and security measures.\n* **Domain Adaptability**: The best foundation models can incorporate high-level, abstract data and exhibit creativity in their outputs. Once a foundation model with suitable power and functionality has been selected, fine-tuning can further ramp up performance in specialized domains and use cases. This [supervised learning](/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/supervised-learning/) phase adapts the LLM to a desired domain without fundamentally retraining the foundation model.  \n     \n   Aligning feature distributions by emphasizing data that has characteristics shared between domains in both the initial training and fine-tuning phases of development is also an effective way to boost domain adaptability.  \n     \n   LLMs are a type of language-generating AI that applies extensively trained neural networks to evaluate and respond to prompts. “Large” doesn’t have a defined threshold—what qualifies for that attribute keeps growing as models become more sophisticated and computing power, especially access to GPU clusters, more abundant.  \n     \n   Before training begins, the language is converted into tokens, which are numeric representations of words or parts of alphabets and speech that computers can understand.  \n     \n   Then an algorithm—which includes an extensive computer neural network—and data set are selected for self-supervised learning. During the training phase, the algorithm adjusts its billions or even trillions of parameters to accurately predict the next token in a sequence until the model responds appropriately to prompts. As such, the parameters of the model contain the learning gained in the training phase.\n* **Core Transformer Architecture**: Transformers were the conceptual leap that ushered in the current wave of enthusiasm around LLMs and [generative AI](/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/what-is-generative-ai/). Proposed in a groundbreaking paper by researchers at Google in 2017, the transformer architecture strayed from previous approaches to creating language models. Instead of relying strictly on a process called recurrence, which involves a sequential series of inputs and outputs, transformers implement a mechanism called “self-attention” that simultaneously considers the relationship between several words—even those distant from one another in a flow of text—as it processes sentences. It does this by creating three different vectors: one for the word under consideration, another for surrounding words to establish their importance in understanding the word, and a third vector that represents the information the word contains. This third vector will have a different value depending on the context of the word. For instance, blue might mean the color, or it might indicate a person’s mood, or it could mean a great expanse of consideration, as in, “the thought came to her out of the blue.”  \n     \n   For example, the text string might be:  \n   “How are you feeling?” she asked.  \n     \n   “I’m not sure,” he answered. “I can’t really get into work today, and it’s been this way for a while. I’m just so blue.”   \n     \n   Before self-attention became part of the process, algorithms had no way to catch the relationship between “feeling” and “blue,” so misinterpretation was likely. Self-attention provides a way to establish the importance of the connection between the two words, even though they aren’t near each other in the word sequence.  \n     \n   Further, by using self-attention, models can be trained on vast amounts of data in parallel, essentially processing sentences at a time rather than going word by word. That takes further advantage of the capabilities of GPUs. Transformers can also analyze tokens from a prompt simultaneously to deliver answers faster and better resolve ambiguities.\n* **Training and Fine-Tuning**: Foundation models, the current workhorse LLMs, are trained on a corpus of data often pulled from the internet and other repositories of written information. Successful models resulting from this self-supervised learning interval, in which billions of parameters are iteratively adjusted, tend to be good at delivering generalized outputs: creating text across contexts, understanding meaning from different styles of speech, and presenting complex or even abstract ideas.  \n     \n   A foundation model can be fine-tuned to improve its accuracy and optimize its performance within a specific domain, such as healthcare or finance, or use case, such as translation or summarization. The fine-tuning process starts with the foundation model, then further trains the final LLM on smaller, more precise sets of labeled data to hone its ability to tackle specific tasks useful to a business sector or application.\n* **Importance of Model and Scalability**: LLM developers ultimately decide on the number of parameters to be trained with their algorithm and how much data they need to do so effectively. The larger the number, the more complex the resulting model and, usually, the more unique, accurate, and relevant the outputs. But with that superior performance comes higher training and operational costs—and challenges in scaling to serve more users once the model is trained.  \n     \n   The scalability of any LLM deployment is partially determined by the quality of the model. The training algorithm, model architecture, and data set chosen by AI developers all affect how well their foundation models optimize consumption of resources, such as memory, processors, and energy, to perform their desired functions.  \n     \n   New techniques are also emerging for reducing the model size and corpus of training data, which eases the cost and difficulty of scaling, without significantly affecting an LLM’s performance, particularly where the LLM will be used for narrower use cases.\n\n## Benefits and Applications of Large Language Models\n\nLLMs are the engine under the hood for many types of cutting-edge applications. The general public largely discovered their jaw-dropping capabilities with the advent of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s browser-based release of the GPT-3.5 model and more recent versions, including GPT-4o and GPT-4. But the benefits extend into and across the enterprise, where LLMs are showcasing their skills in industries and business divisions that include financial services, HR, retail, marketing and sales, software development, customer support, and healthcare.\n\nPopular business applications of LLMs include customer service chatbots, customer sentiment analysis, and translation services that are contextual, colloquial, and natural sounding. LLMs are also performing more specialized tasks behind the scenes, such as predicting protein structures during pharmaceutical research, writing software code, and powering the agents that enterprises are increasingly deploying to automate business processes.\n\n* **Versatility Across Applications**: LLMs are the core technology that powers a diverse and expanding number of consumer-facing and enterprise applications. This versatility stems from the process of self-training the models on large data sets, which yields an AI extremely adept at analyzing complex patterns within data to create relevant, contextual outputs.  \n     \n   Cutting-edge applications take advantage of this attribute to do tasks like write unique marketing copy and reports, gauge customer sentiment, summarize documents, and even generate outputs unrelated to language, such as images and audio. [AI agents](/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents/) particularly exemplify the versatility of LLMs in their ability to interact with an environment and perform tasks across domains without specialized knowledge.  \n     \n   The process of fine-tuning the models with supervised learning further expands the range of business applications that can be built on generative AI. And RAG can make LLMs more effective in enterprise environments as it improves the accuracy and relevance of their outputs by incorporating proprietary business data that can be continually updated without changing the underlying model.\n* **Enhanced Customer Interactions**: LLMs quickly proved their mettle in [the domain of customer service](https://blogs.oracle.com/observability/post/genai-powered-digital-assistant). This is an obvious use case for anyone who has experienced an LLM’s ability to hold a dialogue by answering one nuanced question after another with clear, detailed, and useful outputs.  \n     \n   LLMs, however, can enhance customer interactions in many ways beyond chatbots. Some enterprises use them to generate emails, text messages, or social media posts to customers addressing product, technical, or sales-related questions. Others have put LLMs to work translating inquiries from customers who speak foreign languages. LLMs can also be configured to assist sales and support agents—human and AI—by providing them with actionable information and relevant documentation, summarizing previous interactions, following up with customers, and documenting the interactions.  \n     \n   One of the world’s largest professional services firms doing business in more than 100 countries recently increased its focus on customer relationship management by embracing generative AI applications powered by LLMs. Looking to glean more insights from client feedback surveys, [the company deployed LLMs](/customers/aon-case-study/) to analyze sentiment in those responses. The AI can now highlight trends and provide broad insights into how products and services are received and how they can be improved.\n* **Automation and Productivity**: LLMs are proving extremely effective at automating repetitive tasks, including those involving decisions too complex for earlier AI models to take on. This automation can help boost employee productivity by freeing workers to focus on more high-level endeavors that require creative and critical thinking.  \n     \n   Agents are an emerging technology at the forefront of taking advantage of the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide workflows with minimal human intervention. These applications, built on foundation language models, are designed to make decisions as they interact with humans and other software within enterprise environments, and they can autonomously perform tasks in various domains, generating notifications of actions that need review or authorization to help ensure oversight.  \n     \n   LLMs are also enhancing productivity in other ways, including quickly surfacing relevant information for business leaders and other decision-makers, creating drafts of copy for marketers, and writing software code in tandem with developers.\n\n## Large Language Models Use Cases and Examples\n\nLLMs are being applied to an ever-expanding number of [business use cases](/artificial-intelligence/solutions/). Many companies now use chatbots as part of their customer service strategies, for example. But thanks to the versatility of these models, creative enterprise software developers are applying the underlying technology to tackle a wide range of tasks that go beyond simply generating linguistic responses.\n\n**1. Customer Support Automation**\n\nCustomer support is the most evident application of LLMs in enterprise settings—especially to customers. Conversational user interfaces, or chatbots, powered by language models can field a nearly unlimited number of inquiries at all hours. This can help dramatically reduce response times stemming from overburdened call center staff, a major source of customer frustration.\n\nIntegration of chatbots with other LLM-powered applications can automate follow-up actions after a support call, such as sending a replacement machine part, document, or survey. LLMs can also directly assist human agents, providing them with timely information, sentiment analysis, translation, and summaries of interactions.\n\nA funds manager operating in more than 50 countries and 80 languages has [taken advantage of these capabilities](https://blogs.oracle.com/digitalassistant/post/profuturo-achieves-150-increase-in-service-levels-and-30-reduction-in-operational-costs) to make it easier for its customers to discover and choose the financial vehicles that best fit their needs. The retirement account management specialist modernized its customer support with a custom chatbot that delivered a 150% increase in service levels and 30% reduction in operational costs. Customers now can visit the company’s webpage and ask the chatbot questions about their accounts at any time of day and in many languages.\n\n**2. Content Generation and Summarization**\n\nLLMs can create original content or summarize existing content. Both use cases are extremely useful to companies large and small, which are putting generative AI to work writing reports, emails, blogs, marketing materials, and social media posts while taking advantage of LLMs’ ability to tailor that generated content to specific groups or individual customers.\n\nSummarization condenses large amounts of information, with sensitivity to the domain, into a format easier for humans to quickly review and absorb. LLMs do this by either assessing the importance of various ideas within a text and then extracting key sections or by generating concise overviews of what they deem the most relevant and critical information from the original text.\n\nLLMs are sometimes critiqued as “summarizing to average,” meaning their summaries are overly generic and miss key details or important points of emphasis of the original material. It’s also tricky to gauge the reliability of summaries and rank the performance of various models accordingly. Nonetheless, companies are enthusiastically adopting this capability.\n\nOne leading cloud communications company deployed LLMs to [automatically summarize transcripts](/customers/intermedia/) of hundreds of support tickets and transcripts of chats taking place daily in almost two dozen languages. Those summaries now help support engineers resolve customer challenges faster and elevate the overall experience.\n\n**3. Language Translation**\n\nGoogle’s initial intent in developing transformers was to make machines better at translating between languages; only later did the model impress developers with its broader capabilities. Those developers’ first implementations of this architecture achieved that goal, delivering unrivaled performance in English-to-German translation with a model that took significantly less time and computing resources to train than its predecessors.\n\nModern LLMs have gone well beyond this limited use case. Although most LLMs aren’t specifically trained as translators, they still excel at interpreting text in one language and clearly restating it in another when they’re extensively trained on data sets in both languages. This breakthrough in breaking down language barriers is extremely valuable to enterprises that operate across borders. Multinational companies use advanced language services to, for example, develop multilingual support for their products and services; translate guides, tutorials, and marketing assets; and use existing educational assets to train workers when expanding into new countries.\n\n## The Road Ahead for LLMs\n\n**Advancements in Multimodal Models**\n\nAn active area of research is using LLMs as foundation models for AI that generates outputs in modalities other than language. The impressive versatility of LLMs makes it possible, through a process of fine-tuning using labeled data, to interpret and create audio, images, and even video. These models that receive prompts or generate outputs in modalities other than language are sometimes called large multimodal models, or LMMs.\n\n**Environmental Considerations**\n\nLLMs typically require massive amounts of computing power to develop and operate at scale. Training a single model on a cluster of hundreds or sometimes thousands of GPUs over many weeks can consume massive amounts of energy. And once a successful model is deployed, the infrastructure that runs inference continues to demand substantial electricity to field constant user queries.\n\nTraining GPT-4 required an estimated 50 gigawatt-hours of energy. In comparison, 50 gigawatt-hours of energy could, theoretically, power 4,500 to 5,000 average US homes for a year. Now, ChatGPT is estimated to consume hundreds of megawatt hours every day to respond to millions of queries. As language models get bigger, concerns about energy consumption and sustainability may grow more pressing. For that reason, artificial intelligence companies are at the forefront of seeking out alternative energy sources to reduce their carbon footprints.\n\n## Build LLM Applications with OCI Generative AI\n\nOracle puts the power of LLMs in the hands of enterprises without requiring them to grapple with the nuts and bolts—or power demands—of this exciting technology. [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI](/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/generative-ai-service/) is a fully managed service that simplifies deployment of the latest LLMs in a way that’s customized, highly effective, and cost-efficient while avoiding management of complex infrastructure. Enterprises can select from several foundation models, then fine-tune them on dedicated GPU clusters with their own data, yielding custom models that best serve their business needs.\n\nEnterprises seeking to do more tinkering with the underlying technology are turning to [Machine Learning in Oracle Database](/artificial-intelligence/database-machine-learning/). The platform empowers data scientists to build models quickly by simplifying and automating key elements of the machine learning lifecycle without having to migrate sensitive data from their Oracle databases. Features include popular machine learning frameworks, APIs, automated machine learning (AutoML), and no-code interfaces, as well as more than 30 high performance in-database algorithms for producing models to use in applications.\n\nMany leading organizations also take advantage of [Oracle AI infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/ai-infrastructure/) to build their own LLMs. AI infrastructure is what underpins higher level AI services, such as OCI Generative AI, and can be used for the most demanding LLMs with accelerated compute, networking, and storage.\n\nThe potential for LLMs to transform how businesses operate and engage with their customers is so great that new breakthroughs and investments in the technology can move global markets and shake up enterprise strategies. But it’s important for business and IT leaders to look beyond the hype—understand the basics of how LLMs work, as well as their limitations and the challenges in adopting them—even as they strive to identify the many tangible benefits they may gain from the technology.\n\nLLMs are behind many of the game-changing technologies transforming the way we work.\n\n[Access the ebook](/artificial-intelligence/10-ways-ai-will-deliver-business-value-in-2025-form/ "Access the free ebook")\n\n## LLM FAQs\n\n**How are large language models fine-tuned for specific applications?**\n\nLLMs are fine-tuned for specific applications by following the initial pretraining phase that employs self-learning to develop a foundation model with a supervised learning phase on a smaller amount of more domain-specific, labeled data.\n\n**What industries benefit most from using large language models?**\n\nAlmost every industry is discovering the benefits of LLMs. Healthcare, financial services, and retail are among those exploring a variety of use cases around improving customer support and automating business processes.\n\n**Can large language models be integrated with enterprise systems?**\n\nLarge language models are often integrated with enterprise systems by fine-tuning foundation models with enterprise data and augmenting those models with proprietary data through retrieval-augmented generation.')]), SearchResults(query=Query(query='History and evolution of large language models technology'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/history-and-evolution-of-llms/', title='History and Evolution of LLMs - GeeksforGeeks', raw_content="# History and Evolution of LLMs\n\nLast Updated : \n23 Jul, 2025\n\nSuggest changes\n\n3 Likes\n\n****AI**** has completely transformed the interaction pattern between ****humans**** and ****computers****.

The First Steps in NLP (1960s - 1990s)****\n\nThe journey of ****Large Language Models (LLMs)**** began in 1966 with [****ELIZA****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/eliza-the-first-step-in-human-computer-interaction-through-natural-language-processing/), a simple ****chatbot**** that mimickedconversation using predefined rules but lacked true understanding. By the 1980s, AI transitioned from ****manual rules to**** [****statistical models****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/difference-between-statistical-model-and-machine-learning/), improving [****text analysis****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/what-is-text-analytics/). In the ****1990s****, [****Recurrent Neural Networks****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-network/) ****(RNNs)**** introduced the ability to process sequential data, laying the foundation for modern NLP.\n\n### ****2. The Rise of Neural Networks and Machine Learning (1997 - 2010)****\n\nA breakthrough came in 1997 with [****Long Short-Term Memory****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning/deep-learning-introduction-to-long-short-term-memory/) ****(LSTM)****, which solved ****RNNs****’ memory limitations, making ****AI**** better at understanding long sentences. By 2010, tools like ****Stanford’s CoreNLP**** helped researchers process text more efficiently.\n\n### ****3. The AI Revolution and the Birth of Modern LLMs (2011 - 2017)****\n\nThe ****AI revolution**** gained momentum in 2011 with [****Google Brain****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/what-is-google-brain/), which leveraged big data and ****deep learning**** for advanced language processing. In 2013, ****Word2Vec**** improved ****AI’s**** ability to understand word relationships through ****numerical representations****. Then in 2017, Google introduced [****Transformers****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/getting-started-with-transformers/) in **“Attention is All You Need,”** revolutionizing ****LLMs**** by making them faster, smarter, and more powerful.\n\n### ****4. The Deep Learning Era: Large-Scale LLMs Take Over (2018 - Present)****\n\nThe deep learning era took off in 2018 with [****BERT****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/explanation-of-bert-model-nlp/), which enhanced context understanding in sentences. [****OpenAI’s****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/openai-python-api/) ****GPT series**** (2018-2024) transformed AI-powered text generation, while platforms like [****Hugging Face****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/how-to-access-huggingface-api-key/) ****and Meta’s**** [****LLaMA****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/websites-apps/chatgpt-vs-llama/) made open-source ****LLMs**** widely accessible, shaping the future of AI-driven applications.\n\n## Comparison of Major Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\n| Model | Year | Developer | Architecture | Key Features | Limitations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ELIZA | 1966 | MIT | Rule-Based | First chatbot, keyword matching | No real understanding, limited responses |\n| LSTM | 1997 | Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber | Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) | Overcomes vanishing gradient problem, better memory retention | Struggles with long-term dependencies |\n| Word2Vc | 2013 | Google | Neural Embeddings | Captures word relationships, semantic similarity | Context-independent representations |\n| BERT | 2018 | Google | Transformer (Bidirectional) | Context-aware understanding, fine-tuned for NLP tasks | Cannot generate text, requires large datasets |\n| GPT-2 | 2019 | OpenAI | Transformer (Unidirectional) | Large-scale text generation, creative writing | Prone to biases, generates misinformation |\n| GPT-3 | 2020 | OpenAI | Transformer (Unidirectional) | 175B parameters, human-like text generation, few-shot learning | High computational cost, occasional factual errors |\n| GPT-4 | 2023 | OpenAI | Transformer (Multimodal) | Handles text, images, and code, more accurate responses | Still expensive, not fully autonomous |\n| Gemma 3 | 2025 | Google | Transformer (Self-Learning) | Enhanced factual accuracy, real-time learning | Emerging, yet to be widely tested |\n\n## Different Types of LLMs\n\n### ****1. Pre-Trained Models****\n\nModels like [****GPT-4****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/gpt-4-vs-gpt-3/)****, XLNet, and T5**** are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to generate human-like responses, ****translate languages, summarize text****, and more. They serve as general-purpose ****AI tools**** that can handle a variety of tasks without additional training.\n\n### ****2. Fine-Tuned Models****\n\nModels like ****BERT,**** [****ROBERTa****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/overview-of-roberta-model/)****, and**** [****ALBERT****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/albert-a-light-bert-for-supervised-learning/) start as pre-trained models but are further refined on specific [****datasets****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/what-is-dataset/) for specialized tasks. For example, BERT can be fine-tuned for ****sentiment analysis, legal text processing, or medical diagnostics****, making it more accurate for those particular use cases.\n\n### ****3. Multimodal LLMs****\n\nAI is no longer limited to just text. Models like ****CLIP and**** [****DALL·E****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/what-is-dall-e/) can understand and generate ****images**** based on ****text prompts****, bringing ****AI**** closer to human-like perception. Meanwhile, speech-enabled models like [****Whisper****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/openai-whisper/) are revolutionizing voice recognition, making AI more accessible through spoken language.\n\n### 4. Domain-Specific LLMs\n\nThese are designed for specialized industries like healthcare, finance, and law. Instead of general knowledge, these models are ****trained**** on ****industry-specific data**** to provide more accurate insights. For example, ****Med-PaLM**** helps ****doctors**** by understanding ****medical texts**** and answering health-related ****queries****, while ****BloombergGPT**** is tailored for ****financial markets, analyzing stock trends and news****. These models ensure ****AI**** delivers expert-level accuracy in specialized fields.\n\n## Limitation and Concerns\n\n****Large Language Models (LLMs)**** have revolutionized how we interact with technology, but their rise brings several challenges and ****ethical dilemmas**** that require careful consideration.\n\n### ****1. The Bias Problem: When AI Learns the Wrong Things****\n\n****LLMs**** learn from vast ****datasets**** that may contain [****biases****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/bias-in-machine-learning-identifying-mitigating-and-preventing-discrimination/) present in society. When ****biases**** are present in the data used to train ****AI**** systems, they can be incorporated and even enhanced into the ****AI**** systems, resulting in ****unfair outcomes****. Research reveals that ****AI models**** that are used in mortgage lending are likely to ****discriminate**** against Black applicants, as it reflects the prevailing ****social bias****. However, in the case of ****AI**** tools in ****hiring****, they tend to prefer some groups of candidates over others, which is a significant issue for ****fairness**** and ****equality****.\n\n### ****2. Privacy Risks: Who Owns the Data LLMs Learn From?****\n\n****LLMs**** are trained across huge ****datasets****, which may include ****copyright**** and ****private materials****, though such practice raises ****ethics**** on ownershipand consent in data. It's still taking shape in the legalecosystem concerning ****AI-generated content****, thus leaving gray areas around intellectual property rights and proprietary data use without express ****permission****. The lack of clarity is threateningto individuals and organizations regarding their ****privacy**** and ****data security.****\n\n### ****3. Computational Costs and Environmental Impact****\n\nThe use of huge ****computations**** during training ****LLMs**** will end in significant ****energy consumption**** and ****wide-ranging carbon emissions****. ****GPT-3's**** training alone is reported to have had a pretty ****high carbon footprint**** as ****environmental**** concerns arise with large-scale ****AI models.**** Because of these, researchersare studying other ****energy-efficient architectures****, such as [****sparse****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/sparse-table/) expert models, to make reiteration efforts less environmentally impactful while still being high-performance.\n\nAs ****LLMs**** become more ****integrated**** into various applications, addressing these ****ethical**** and ****environmental challenges**** is crucial to ensure that ****AI**** technologies benefit society ****responsibly**** and ****sustainably****.\n\n## Future of ****LLM****\n\nThe next wave of ****Large Language Models (LLMs)**** will push the boundaries of AI intelligence, making them ****more adaptive, interactive, and efficient****. Here’s what lies ahead:\n\n### ****Adaptive AI: Models That Evolve in Real Time****\n\n****AI**** system is fed with an open-world ****model**** and looks out to observe changes like a ****regular human.**** Companies like ****Anthropic**** and ****OpenAI**** are looking to implement a system whereby ****AIs**** will be made aware of context and will evolve in real-time to improve their performance, negating the need for ****data collection**** of feedbackloops running on existing ****databases****.\n\n### ****Personalized AI Assistants: Smarter and More Context-Aware****\n\nThe new waves of the future will be ****AI assistants****, which sometimes understand users better than friends or relatives, truly recalling past interactions and changing the ****response accordingly****. Wouldn't it be great to have ****AI**** customize its ****tone**** and ****recommendations**** and also change the methods of problem-solving just because a user does it in a particular style? Personalized AI into the [****operating system****](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/what-is-an-operating-system/) would redefine all digital interaction in daily life, with pioneering companies like ****Apple**** and ****Microsoft**** in the business of ****deeply embedding**** an AI system.\n\n### ****Beyond Text: LLMs in Robotics, VR, and the Metaverse****\n\nLLMs are moving beyond text processing and into ****real-world applications****. The design of ****multi-modal AI models,**** such as ****Gemini and GPT-4 Turbo,**** is to create understandingand interactivityacross ****text, images, and speech. AI**** is also transforming fields such as ****VR and robotics to**** facilitate life-likedigital humans engaged in real-time metaverse conversations****.**** Firms securing this transition intodigital experiences with ****AI-assisted avatars**** include Meta and Nvidia.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n****Large Language Models (LLMs)**** have evolved from ****simple rule-based systems**** to ****powerful AI assistants**** that generate human-like text, code, and even images. Their impact is undeniable, transforming industries, automating tasks, and enhancing creativity. However, challenges remain. ****Bias, misinformation, data privacy, and the environmental impact**** of training massive models need urgent solutions. AI must become ****more ethical, transparent, and efficient**** to ensure responsible usage.\n\nLooking ahead, LLMs will continue to shape the way we work, learn, and communicate. The real question is: ****How do we harness AI’s potential while ensuring it aligns with human values?**** The future of AI is not just about smarter models—it’s about how we choose to use them.\n\n> ****Must Read:****\n>\n> * [Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/introduction-to-natural-language-processing/)\n> * [Top AI and Machine Learning Frameworks for Developers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/machine-learning-frameworks/)\n> * [How ChatGPT Works: Behind the Scenes of AI Chatbots](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/getting-started-with-chatgpt-a-complete-guide-with-examples/)\n\n  \n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/surajwqgmw/)\n\n[surajwqgmw](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/surajwqgmw/)\n\nImprove\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/surajwqgmw/)\n\n[surajwqgmw](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/surajwqgmw/)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n* [GBlog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/blogs/)\n* [AI-ML-DS Blogs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/ai-ml-ds/data-science-blogs/)\n* [Machine Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/machine-learning/)\n* [GBlog 2025](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/gblog-2025/)\n\n### Explore\n\n[GBlog - Explore Tech€™s Hottest Topics & Career Growth Hacks!\n\n2 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/gblog-gq/)\n\n## How To Become\n\n[How to become a Java Developer?\n\n6 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfg-academy/how-to-become-a-java-developer/)[How to Become a GenAI Developer\n\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/how-to-become-an-ai-developer/)[How to become a Cloud Network Engineer?\n\n11 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfg-academy/how-to-become-a-cloud-network-engineer/)[How to Become a DevSecOps Engineer\n\n9 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfg-academy/how-to-become-a-devsecops-engineer/)[How to become an Automation Tester?\n\n11 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfg-academy/how-to-become-an-automation-tester/)\n\n## Roadmap\n\n[Full Stack Developer Roadmap\n\n11 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/full-stack-developer-roadmap/)[Complete DevOps Roadmap - Beginner to Advanced\n\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/devops/devops-roadmap/)[Machine Learning Roadmap\n\n11 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/machine-learning-roadmap/)[Data Analyst Roadmap\n\n1 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/data-analyst-roadmap/)\n\n## Interview Preparation\n\n[Interview Preparation Roadmap\n\n5 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/interview-preparation-roadmap/)[Top Interview Problems Asked in 2024 (Topic Wise)\n\n2 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/top-interview-problems-asked-in-2024-topic-wise/)[Top HR Interview Questions and Answers (2025)\n\n15+ min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hr/hr-interview-questions/)[Database Administrator Interview Questions\n\n14 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-experiences/database-administrator-interview-questions/)[Aptitude Questions and Answers\n\n3 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/aptitude/aptitude-questions-and-answers/)\n\n## Project Ideas\n\n[10 Best Computer Science Projects Ideas for Final Year Students\n\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/best-computer-science-projects-ideas-for-final-year-students/)[Top 10 Mini Project Ideas For Computer Science Students\n\n7 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/mini-project-ideas-for-computer-science-students/)[30+ Web Development Projects with Source Code [2025]\n\n4 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/web-development-projects/)[Top 10 Data Science Project Ideas for Beginners\n\n13 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/data-science-project-ideas-for-beginners/)[Java Project Ideas For Beginners and Advanced\n\n15+ min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/java-projects/)[10 Best Linux Project Ideas For Beginners\n\n7 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/linux-project-ideas-for-beginners/)[Top 7 Python Project Ideas for Beginners in 2025\n\n6 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-project-ideas-for-beginners/)\n\n## Certification\n\n[Top Machine Learning Certifications in 2025\n\n9 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/top-machine-learning-certifications/)[DevOps Certification - A Way to Enhance Growth Opportunities\n\n4 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/devops-certification-a-way-to-enhance-growth-opportunities/)[Top 10 Highest Paying Certifications\n\n11 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/highest-paying-certifications/)[Tech Certifications: Worth the Effort in 2025?\n\n9 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/tech-certifications-worth-the-effort/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovement\n\nSuggest Changes\n\nHelp us improve.

Foote   Published: December 28, 2023\n\nLarge language models are artificial neural networks (algorithms) that have gone from a recent development to widespread use within a few years. They have been instrumental in the development of ChatGPT, the next evolutionary step in artificial intelligence. Generative AI was combined with large language models to produce a smarter version of artificial intelligence.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are based on artificial neural networks, and recent improvements in deep learning have supported their development.\n\nA large language model also uses semantic technology (semantics, the semantic web, and natural language processes). The history of large language models starts with the concept of semantics, developed by the French philologist, Michel Bréal, in 1883. Bréal studied the ways languages are organized, how they change as time passes, and how words connect within a language.\n\nCurrently, semantics is used for languages developed for humans, such as Dutch or Hindi, and artificial programming languages, such as Python and Java.\n\nNatural language processing, however, is focused on translating human communications into a language understood by computers, and back again. It uses systems that can provide an understanding of human instructions, allowing computers to understand written text, recognize speech, and translate between computer and human languages.\n\n## **How Natural Language Processing Was Almost Lost Before It Started**\n\nFrom 1906 to 1912, Ferdinand de Saussure taught Indo-European linguistics, general linguistics, and Sanskrit at the University of Geneva. During this time he developed the foundation for a highly functional model of languages as systems.\n\nThen, in 1913, he died, before organizing and publishing his work.\n\nFortunately, Albert Sechehaye and Charles Bally, two instructors who were also Saussure’s colleagues, recognized the potential of his concepts and decided they were important enough to save. The two instructors collected his notes for his future manuscript, and then made the effort to gather the notes of Saussure’s students. Based on these, they wrote Saussere’s book, titled\xa0*Cours de Linguistique Générale*(translated to\xa0[*Language as a Science*](https://ia802607.us.archive.org/8/items/courseingenerall00saus/courseingenerall00saus.pdf), which eventually evolved into natural language processing (NLP), which was published in 1916.\n\n*Language as a Science*\xa0laid the foundation of the\xa0[structuralist approach](https://anthropology.ua.edu/theory/structuralism/), and later, natural language processes.\n\n## **The Need for Language Translation Jump-Starts Natural Language Processing**\n\nAfter the end of World War II (1945), the field of\xa0[natural language processing](https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-natural-language-processing-nlp/)\xa0received a great deal of attention. Peace talks and the desire for international trade prompted recognition of the importance of understanding one another and promoted the hopes of creating a machine that could translate languages, automatically.\n\nNot too surprisingly, the goal of building a language translation machine wasn’t as easy as first assumed. However, while human languages are filled with chaos and broken rules, the language of mathematics is not. Language translation machines could be adapted quite successfully to mathematics, with its unchangeable rules.\n\n## **Machine Learning and the Game of Checkers**\n\nArthur Samuel of IBM developed a computer program for\xa0[playing checkers](https://medium.com/ibm-data-ai/the-first-of-its-kind-ai-model-samuels-checkers-playing-program-1b712fa4ab96)\xa0in the early 1950s. He completed a number of algorithms that allowed his checker-playing program to improve and described it as “[machine learning](https://www.dataversity.net/machine-learning-101-2/)” in 1959.\n\n## **The Mark 1 Perceptron Uses Neural Networks**\n\nIn 1958, Frank Rosenblatt, of the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, merged Hebb’s algorithmic model of neural networks with Samuel’s work on machine learning, creating the first artificial neural network, called the Mark 1 Perceptron. Although language translation was still a goal, computers were being built primarily for mathematical purposes (much less chaotic than languages). These huge computers, built with vacuum tubes, and used as calculators, were not manufactured, but built individually, as were their software programs.\n\nThe Perceptron was also unique because it used software designed for the IBM 704, and established that similar computers could share standardized software programs.\n\nUnfortunately, the\xa0[Mark 1 Perceptron](https://blog.knoldus.com/introduction-to-perceptron-neural-network/)\xa0could not recognize many kinds of basic visual patterns (such as faces), resulting in broken expectations and cuts to neural network research and machine learning.\n\n[dv-promo buttontext=’REGISTER FOR OUR DMBOK AND CDMP PREPARATION TRAINING PROGRAM’ buttonurl=’https://training.dataversity.net/learning-paths/dmbok-and-cdmp-preparation-learning-plan?utm\\_source=dataversity&utm\\_medium=inline\\_ad&utm\\_campaign=DMBOK\\_LP\\_temp2&utm\\_content=copy1′]\n\n## **ELIZA Uses Natural Language Programming**\n\nIn 1966, an MIT computer scientist, Joseph Weizenbaum, developed ELIZA, which is described as the first program using NLP. It could identify keywords from the input it received, and respond with a pre-programmed answer.\n\nWeizenbaum was attempting to prove his assumption that the communications between humans and machines were fundamentally superficial, but things didn’t work out as planned. To simplify the experiment and minimize disputes, Weizenbaum developed a program using “[active listening](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/coaching-others-use-active-listening-skills/),” which did not require a database storing real-world information, but would reflect back a person’s statements to carry the conversation forward.\n\nHe was surprised (perhaps even horrified) that people, including Weizenbaum’s own secretary, described the computer program as having human-like feelings. Weizenbaum\xa0[wrote](https://www.filfre.net/2011/06/eliza-part-3/): “My secretary, who had watched me work on the program for many months and therefore surely knew it to be merely a computer program, started conversing with it. After only a few interactions with it, she asked me to leave the room.” He\xa0[later added](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-eliza-effect/), “I had not realized … that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.”\n\nThe original version of\xa0[ELIZA](https://sites.google.com/view/elizagen-org/the-original-eliza)\xa0recently became open-source and is available\xa0[here](https://github.com/codeanticode/eliza).\n\n## **Machine Learning Carries on as a Separate Industry**\n\nThe years between\xa0[1974 and 1980](https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-machine-learning/)\xa0are referred to as\xa0“the first AI winter.” AI researchers had to deal with two very basic limitations: small amounts of data storage and painfully slow processing speeds. Most universities had abandoned neural network research and a schism developed between AI and machine learning. Before this schism, ML was used primarily to train artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, the machine learning industry, which included several researchers and technicians, reorganized itself into a separate field. After the schism, the ML industry shifted its focus to probability theory and statistics, while continuing to work with neural networks. ML was used to answer phones and perform a variety of automated tasks.\n\n## **Small Language Models**\n\nEarly development of the first (small)\xa0[language models](http://verbit.ai/understanding-language-models-and-artificial-intelligence/)\xa0was started in the 1980s by IBM, and they were/are designed to predict the next word in a sentence. Part of their design includes a “dictionary,” which determines how often certain words occur within the text the model was trained on. After each word, the algorithm recalculates statistically what the following word should be. (This limited statistical model does not support the creativity offered by ChatGPT.)\n\n## **NLP Is combined with Machine Learning and Research Funding Returns**\n\nBy the late 1980s, computational power had increased significantly. Additionally, machine algorithms had improved and a revolution in natural language processing came about. It was the result of both the steady increase of computational power and the shift to machine learning algorithms. (Prior to the 1980s, most NLP systems used complicated, “handwritten” rules.)\n\nDuring the 1990s, the use of statistical models for NLP analyses increased dramatically because of their speed and the tremendous flow of text moving through the internet.\n\n## **The World Wide Web Provides a Massive Source of Data**\n\nTim Berners-Lee thought of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, and it was made available to the public in 1991. The World Wide Web makes it possible for large library models to access massive amounts of data for research.\n\nThe creation of the World Wide Web made the internet searchable and provided large language models with access to massive amounts of information. The [World Wide Web](https://businessdegrees.uab.edu/blog/internet-vs-world-wide-web-whats-the-difference/)\xa0offers a platform to create, store, locate, and share information on a variety of topics. During the mid-1990s, the WWW initiated new levels of use on the internet, promoting interest in online shopping and what was called “surfing” the internet.\n\n## **GPUs and Large Language Models**\n\nLarge language models require complex training, which includes the use of huge amounts of data containing billions of words and phrases. Training large language models can be described as training the individual pieces of a massive jigsaw puzzle, with each puzzle piece representing a portion of the LLM’s understanding. GPUs ([graphics processing units](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/cpu-vs-gpu)) provide a solution to these problems.\n\nA GPU is an electronic circuit that was originally designed to accelerate the processing of computer graphics and images. GPUs can process several pieces of data simultaneously, which makes them extremely useful for machine learning, gaming applications, video editing, and 3D graphics.\n\nAs the GPU’s memory capacity and speed increased, they played a significant role in developing sophisticated language models.\n\n## **Deep Learning and Large Language Models**\n\nIn the 1990s, the arrival of deep learning supported even more advanced language models. A large language model is a very large deep learning model that is pre-trained on massive amounts of data. [Deep learning](https://www.dataversity.net/brief-history-deep-learning/)\xa0is a form of machine learning, which is also a neural network, but with additional layers.\n\nIn 2011, deep learning began becoming popular. By 2018, deep learning algorithms were being used in every industry, from photography to online detail. Some of the ways deep learning applications were used include Apple’s Siri, automated drug design, and NLP for sentiment analysis.\n\n## **The Generative Adversarial Neural Network**\n\nIn 2014, Ian Goodfellow introduced the\xa0[Generative Adversarial Neural Network](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/)\xa0(a concept prompted by a conversation with friends while at a bar). The design uses two neural networks, which play against one another in a game. The game’s goal is for one of the networks to imitate a photo, tricking the opposing network into believing the imitation is real. The opposing network is looking for flaws – evidence the photo is not real. The game continues to be played until the photo is so close to perfect it tricks its opponent.\n\n## **Large Language Models Support Smarter AI**\n\nNear the end of 2022, OpenAI released\xa0ChatGPT and changed the world of AI, dramatically.

Among the most notable contributions are the transformer-based models, such as BERT, GPT-3, and T5, which have set new benchmarks in language understanding and generation tasks. In this article, we will dive into these state-of-the-art models.\n\n# **Transformer**\n\nThe **Transformer** is a deep-learning model that uses a self-attention mechanism. **Self-attention** works by establishing an amount of importance or relationship between a given word and all its surroundings.\n\n> Before going into details, keep in mind that **word embedding** is a real value numerical representation of a word, this representation encodes the meaning of a word, and this will help to check which other word has a similar encoding. Similar encoding means words are highly related to each other.\n\nBack to self-attention!\n\n> For example, if I have this sentence:\n>\n> “Today I am writing an article about a search engine.”\n\nAnd let’s say I want to compute the self-attention of the word “article”.\n\nSA(‘article’) = amount of relation between the word “article” and the other words in the sentence (SA = Self-attention).\n\nEach arrow represents an amount of attention between the word “article” and any word in the sentence. In other terms, each arrow shows how much these two words are related to each other. We should note that this is only the attention of one word, we should repeat this step for all other words.\n\nAt the end of the process, we will obtain a vector for each word containing numerical values that represent the word + its relationship with the others.\n\n# **Why did they create self-attention mechanism?**\n\nThe reason behind creating a self-attention mechanism is because of the limitations found in other basic models.\n\nFor example, **skip-gram** is a model that generates word embeddings. During the training phase of skip-gram, it learns to predict a specific number of words surrounding given a single word as input. Usually, we specify the **window size** which is how many surrounded words will be given as input.\n\nBut the main limitation of this model is that the prediction of a given word will be based only on a limited number of surrounding words. On the other hand, not only self-attention is checking all other words in the sentence, but it also gives a degree of importance to them.\n\n> Example: how can an ML model predict the word “river” of the following sentence: Bank of a (river)\n\nBank and river have completely different meanings, but they are correlated in this sentence. **Skip-gram** might not be able to predict the correct word because maybe in the training phase, the model didn’t encounter the word river with the bank, or the word river was outside the window size given during training.\n\nFor a better understanding of the self-attention mechanism, you can visit these articles :\n\n[## An intuitive explanation of Self Attention\n\n### A step-by-step explanation of the multi-headed self-attention block\n\ntowardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-intuitive-explanation-of-self-attention-4f72709638e1?source=post_page-----4cf8915dd86f---------------------------------------)\n\n[## Illustrated: Self-Attention\n\n### A step-by-step guide to self-attention with illustrations and code\n\ntowardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-self-attention-2d627e33b20a?source=post_page-----4cf8915dd86f---------------------------------------)\n\nNow getting back to The Transformer, it has two advantages, the first one is using the self-attention mechanism and the other is parallel computation (because of the matrices and vectors that allow a parallel calculation). It is composed of two components an **encoder** and a **decoder**.\n\nThe **encoder** will help us retrieve the best meaningful representation of the input sentence. On the other hand, the **decoder** will also get the best representation of a given output + the received output from the encoder, this will help the transformer to start understanding the relationship between the words in both the input, the output, and the relation between the input and the output.\n\nFor example, if we want to have a translator model from English to French. The transformer will start understanding the relationship between the English words, and the relation between the French words then will try to relate the English words to the French words.\n\nNow I will present the Transformer Architecture with a brief information about each component.\n\n# **Transformer Architecture**\n\nIf you are interested in understanding the transformer in-depth, you can read these interesting 4 articles that contain detailed explanations of the transformer: [part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-explained-visually-part-1-overview-of-functionality-95a6dd460452), [part 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-explained-visually-part-2-how-it-works-step-by-step-b49fa4a64f34), [part 3](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-explained-visually-part-3-multi-head-attention-deep-dive-1c1ff1024853), and [part 4](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-explained-visually-not-just-how-but-why-they-work-so-well-d840bd61a9d3). Moreover, you can also read famous research papers [attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf).\n\nAfter we explained the transformer, now we can talk about other models that are based on the Transformer.\n\n# **GPT-3 or Generative pre-trained Transformer**\n\nIt is based on the Transformer’s decoder (explained above), it is composed of a stack of several decoders.\n\nIt is a neural network machine learning model developed by Open AI. After the pre-training phase, the model can take small input and able to generate a lot of words related to the input. It can be used in several applications such as chatbots, summarizers, text classification, translators, and many more.\n\n# **But how were they able to train the model!?**\n\nDuring the pre-training phase, GPT-3 was like a Vacuum 😜. The model was trained on 45 TB of text 😱, and it was trained to do next-word prediction.\n\nGPT-3 was doing unsupervised learning because all 45 TB of text data are not labeled, so imagine you have this large number of texts, and you can mask any word you want and train the model to predict this word. That’s why GPT-3 is so powerful.\n\nThese are some applications of GPT-3, and Open AI has provided 48 example [applications](https://beta.openai.com/examples) of GPT-3, you can check their [PLAYGROUND](https://beta.openai.com/playground) and test this powerful model.\n\n## Get Ali Issa’s stories in\xa0your\xa0inbox\n\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from\xa0this\xa0writer.\n\nGPT-3 contains 4 models (Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada), and each model has its characteristics. They basically differ in the size of each one, and the number of parameters used during training.\n\nYou can learn more about GPT-3 using the following links :\n\n[## What is GPT-3? Everything You Need to Know\n\n### By GPT-3, or the third generation Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a neural network machine learning model…\n\nwww.techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/GPT-3?source=post_page-----4cf8915dd86f---------------------------------------)\n\n[## OpenAI API\n\n### An API for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI\n\nbeta.openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3?source=post_page-----4cf8915dd86f---------------------------------------)\n\nFor testing the performance of GPT-3, you can use [open AI’s playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).\n\nAfter we explained GPT-3 model, now we will talk about the most open-source model similar to GPT-3, which is **GPT-J.**\n\n# GPT-J\n\nIt is an open-source language model, created by a group of researchers from [**EleutherAI**](https://www.eleuther.ai/)**,** it’s a grassroots collective of researchers working to enable open-source AI research. It’s one of the most advanced alternatives to [OpenAI’s](https://openai.com/) GPT-3 and has similar performance in different such as chat, summarization, and question answering to name a few. For more info about GPT-J, you can check the [explanation](https://www.forefront.ai/blog-posts/how-to-use-our-free-gpt-j-playground#:~:text=Tokens%20are%20important%20to%20understand,tokens%2C%20or%20roughly%201500%20words.) and test its performance using this [playground](https://playground.forefront.ai/models/free-gpt-j-playground).\n\n**GPT-J** solves the issue of the high cost of GPT-3 (because it is an open source), but the limitation is in the size of the context with a maximum length of 2048 tokens (1500 words). We should mention that we did a comparison of performance between GPT-J and GPT-3 (in the Q&A domain), we gave them both a context and asked several questions related to it , and the performance was almost the same (in some cases, GPT-J was a little bit less accurate than GPT-3).\n\n# **Now let’s talk about Bert model.**\n\n# **These are some models from the BERT family that I explored. So, what’s BERT?**\n\n1) **BERT Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers** is a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) published by researchers at Google AI Language similar to GPT-3, it takes a component from the transformer, and this time BERT is a stack of the transformer’s encoder.\n\nBert is used in creating word embeddings because as we said the encoder of a transformer tries to get the best representation of a word/sentence. Using Bert, we can understand the idea/meaning behind a sentence.\n\nDuring the pre-training phase, the size of the dataset was over 3.3 billion words. Moreover, two techniques were used:\n\n**MLM (masked language modeling)** and **NSP (next sentence prediction)**.\n\n**NSP**: A pair of sentences (A and B) were given to the model, and it learns to detect if sentence B succeeds A in the corpus. This helps to learn the relation between sentences.\n\n**MLM**: some words will be masked, and the model will learn how to predict these words.\n\n> We will not go into details about Bert, but if you are interested you can visit the following links: [What is Bert?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kLi8u2dJz0) , [BERT Neural Network — EXPLAINED!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI0HHN5XKDo) [BERT Explained: State-of-the-art language model for NLP](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270)\n\n**2)Bert large** has the same concept as Bert, with minor modifications, such as it contains more blocks of the encoder and more parameters, etc… you can visit this small [article](https://iq.opengenus.org/bert-base-vs-bert-large/) about Bert-large and Bert.\n\n**3)BART**: uses more challenging techniques in the masking during the pre-training phase. In the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13461v1.pdf), They stated that it is taught by tampering with text using an arbitrary noise function and then building a model to recreate the original text.\n\n4) **Roberta**: is an abbreviation for “[Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11692.pdf) Approach. This is an improved version of the BERT model in many ways.\n\nThe main differences are **dynamic masking**, **more data points** (more information fed to the model), the removal of the NSP task (explained earlier), a **larger dataset**, and a **large batch size**.\n\n5)**Albert:** a light Bert, this model is larger than Bert, small than Bert-large. The most differences between Bert and Albert are:\n\na) **Inter-Sentence Coherence Prediction**: Albert uses SOP (sentence order prediction instead of NSP. The main difference between the two losses is that NSP checks the topic and the coherence of sentences, on the other hand, SOP checks only the coherence.\n\n**b)Cross-layer parameter sharing**: parameter sharing between the layers will increase the performance and reduce the redundancy.\n\nc)**Factorization of the Embedding matrix:** layer embeddings and hidden layer embeddings have the same size in Bert, but different sizes with Albert. They said this will lead to reducing the number of parameters used with a minor drop in performance.\n\nFor more info about Albert, you can visit this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11942.pdf), [Visual Paper Summary: ALBERT (A Lite BERT)](https://amitness.com/2020/02/albert-visual-summary/) and [Albert-explained-a-lite-bert. md](https://github.com/christianversloot/machine-learning-articles/blob/main/albert-explained-a-lite-bert.md).\n\nAfter the explanation of the models related to Bert. Now we are going to present the **T5 model!!**\n\n# **T5 or Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer**\n\n**It is a transformer-based** architecture, composed of both the encoder and the decoder. It contains 12 transformer blocks with a total of 220 million parameters. The model was pre-trained on a C4 dataset (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus) with 750 GB of English text. Like Bert, T5 uses MLM, and it learns to predict target words.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThe main difference between Bert and T5 is in the size of tokens (words) used in prediction. Bert predicts a target composed of a single word (single token masking), on the other hand, T5 can predict multiple words as you see in the figure above. It gives the model flexibility in terms of learning the model structure.\n\nMore details about T5 can be found in this [article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/understanding-t5-model-text-to-text-transfer-transformer-model-69ce4c165023).\n\n# **Finally, I will give a brief explanation on two other models:**\n\nThe **ELECTRA** model has been proposed in the paper [ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB). The generator and discriminator transformer models are trained as part of the new pretraining method called **ELECTRA**. The generator is trained as a masked language model because its function is to swap tokens in a sequence. Which tokens in the sequence were changed by the generator? The discriminator tells us.\n\nFor a brief comparison between Albert, Roberta, and Electra you can check this[**article**](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-bert-variants-albert-roberta-electra-642dfe51bc23)**.**\n\nFor more explanation about GPT, BERT, and T5, you can watch a video [from Google Cloud tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZorAJ4I-sA) and read its corresponding [blog](https://daleonai.com/transformers-explained), also the [Google Ai blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html) contains useful information about T5.\n\n**Long Former**: is a Bert-like model. Its architecture is a modification of the Transformer. Due to the self-attention operation of standard Transformer-based models, which scale quadratically with sequence length, they are unable to analyze lengthy sequences. Long former employs an attention pattern that grows linearly with sequence length to handle this and makes it simple to process documents with thousands of tokens or more.\n\nAnd the Long Former takes a maximum of (16k tokens or 4096 words). For more information about the Long Former, you can read this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150v2), or watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8KNb5iqblE) that explains the paper. Although this is a good model, but also **4096 words** are insufficient for our case.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of natural language processing has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly with the introduction of transformer-based models such as GPT-3, T5 and BERT. And now with the famous model **ChatGPT**! These models have proven to be highly effective in a wide range of NLP tasks, including language translation, question answering, and text generation. They have also been instrumental in advancing the state-of-the-art in language understanding and representation.\n\nAs more and more organizations begin to incorporate these models into their operations, the potential applications for these technologies continue to grow. It will be exciting to see what further developments and breakthroughs will come in the future of AI.\n\nCurious about the latest in AI and ML?

Among the most prominent models are\xa0**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**,\xa0**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, and\xa0**T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**. These models are built on the Transformer architecture but differ in their approach to processing and generating language. GPT is designed primarily for\xa0**text generation**, making it ideal for chatbots and creative writing. BERT, on the other hand, is optimized for\xa0**language understanding**\xa0tasks like text classification and question answering by analyzing text bidirectionally. T5 is a versatile model that converts\xa0**all NLP tasks into a text-to-text format**, allowing it to handle both understanding and generation tasks effectively. By understanding the differences among these models, we can determine the best use case for each in various applications.\n\n---\n\n## **Detailed Explanation of Each Model**\n\n### **1. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**\n\nGPT is a\xa0**decoder-only**\xa0Transformer model trained using an\xa0**autoregressive approach**, meaning it predicts the next word in a sentence based on previous words. This makes it highly effective for\xa0**text generation**,\xa0**summarization**, and\xa0**dialogue-based applications**. Since it learns by predicting the next token in large text datasets, it excels in creating human-like responses in chatbots, writing assistants, and creative content generation. However, GPT has limitations—it\xa0**lacks deep reasoning**, often produces\xa0**incoherent or biased outputs**, and struggles with\xa0**factual accuracy**\xa0in longer responses.\n\n**Key Features of GPT:**\n\n* **Autoregressive modeling**: Generates text sequentially, predicting one word at a time.\n* **Unidirectional processing**: Focuses only on past tokens while generating text.\n* **Best for text generation**: Ideal for chatbots, content creation, and storytelling.\n\n### **2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**\n\nBERT is an\xa0**encoder-only**\xa0model designed for\xa0**deep language understanding**. Unlike GPT, which processes text sequentially, BERT reads text\xa0**bidirectionally**, meaning it considers the full context of a word from both left and right. This makes BERT highly effective for tasks that require deep text comprehension, such as\xa0**sentiment analysis, text classification, question answering, and named entity recognition (NER)**.\n\nBERT is trained using two main objectives:\n\n1. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**\xa0– Random words in a sentence are masked, and the model predicts them based on surrounding words.\n2. **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**\xa0– The model learns relationships between consecutive sentences.\n\nHowever, BERT is not designed for text generation and struggles with tasks requiring\xa0**coherent text production**.\n\n**Key Features of BERT:**\n\n* **Bidirectional processing**: Reads both left and right context for better understanding.\n* **Pre-trained on large corpora**: Fine-tuned for various NLP tasks.\n* **Best for text comprehension**: Great for classification, Q&A, and NER.\n\n### **3. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**\n\nT5 is a\xa0**encoder-decoder**\xa0Transformer model that treats\xa0**all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems**. Unlike GPT and BERT, which specialize in either generation or understanding, T5\xa0**combines both**\xa0and can handle a wide range of NLP tasks, including\xa0**machine translation, summarization, text classification, and question answering**.\n\nT5 is trained on a massive dataset (C4 – Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus) using a reformulated approach where everything is converted into a text-based task. For example:\n\n* Instead of training a separate model for summarization, T5 takes input as:  \n  **“Summarize: [input text]” → [output summary]**\n* For translation:  \n  **“Translate English to French: [input text]” → [output text]”**\n\nAlthough T5 is highly\xa0**versatile and efficient**, it\xa0**requires more computational power**\xa0than BERT or GPT due to its dual-architecture structure.\n\n**Key Features of T5:**\n\n* **Text-to-text format**: Handles diverse NLP tasks in a unified way.\n* **Encoder-decoder architecture**: Allows both text understanding and generation.\n* **Best for multi-task NLP**: Ideal for translation, summarization, and text-based question answering.\n\n---\n\n### **Comparison Table**\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWhile all three models are built on the Transformer architecture, they have different strengths.\xa0**GPT is best for open-ended text generation**, making it ideal for chatbots, story writing, and content creation.\xa0**BERT is superior for language comprehension tasks**, excelling in classification and Q&A applications.\xa0**T5 is the most versatile**, capable of both understanding and generating text, making it suitable for a wide range of NLP applications. Choosing the right model depends on the specific NLP task, computational resources, and accuracy requirements.\n\n### Share this:\n\n* [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://mdmgenerativeaimodelsblog.wordpress.com/2025/03/14/comparing-large-language-models-gpt-vs-bert-vs-t5/?share=twitter)\n* [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://mdmgenerativeaimodelsblog.wordpress.com/2025/03/14/comparing-large-language-models-gpt-vs-bert-vs-t5/?share=facebook)\n\nLike Loading…\n\n## Comments\n\n### Leave a comment [Cancel reply](/2025/03/14/comparing-large-language-models-gpt-vs-bert-vs-t5/#respond)\n\n## More posts\n\n* ### [The Role of GPT in Social Media Management and Content\xa0Scheduling](https://mdmgenerativeaimodelsblog.wordpress.com/2025/03/20/the-role-of-gpt-in-social-media-management-and-content-scheduling/)\n* ### [Real-World Applications of Large Language Models in\xa0Business](https://mdmgenerativeaimodelsblog.wordpress.com/2025/03/15/real-world-applications-of-large-language-models-in-business/)\n* ### [GPT in Education: Revolutionizing Learning with AI\xa0Tutors](https://mdmgenerativeaimodelsblog.wordpress.com/2025/03/15/gpt-in-education-revolutionizing-learning-with-ai-tutors/)\n* ### [How Large Language Models Are Revolutionizing Content\xa0Creation](https://mdmgenerativeaimodelsblog.wordpress.com/2025/03/15/how-large-language-models-are-revolutionizing-content-creation/)\n\n* [Comment](https://mdmgenerativeaimodelsblog.wordpress.com/2025/03/14/comparing-large-language-models-gpt-vs-bert-vs-t5/#respond)\n* Reblog\n* Subscribe Subscribed\n\n  + [MDM\\_Gen AI\\_Assessment](https://mdmgenerativeaimodelsblog.wordpress.com)* Already have a WordPress.com account?

This article explains what LLM is with several examples.\n\nContents\n\n* [1 What is a Large Language Model?](#What_is_a_Large_Language_Model)\n* [2 What techniques do LLMs use?](#What_techniques_do_LLMs_use)\n* [3 Examples of LLMs](#Examples_of_LLMs)\n  + [3.1 GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3)](#GPT-3_Generative_Pre-trained_Transformer_3)\n  + [3.2 ChatGPT](#ChatGPT)\n  + [3.3 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)](#BERT_Bidirectional_Encoder_Representations_from_Transformers)\n  + [3.4 XLNet (eXtreme MultiLingual Language Model)](#XLNet_eXtreme_MultiLingual_Language_Model)\n  + [3.5 T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)](#T5_Text-to-Text_Transfer_Transformer)\n  + [3.6 RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training Approach)](#RoBERTa_Robustly_Optimized_BERT_pre-training_Approach)\n* [4 Strengths and Limitations of LLMs](#Strengths_and_Limitations_of_LLMs)\n* [5 Responsible AI](#Responsible_AI)\n\n## What is a Large Language Model?\n\n**A Large Language Model (LLM)** is a machine learning model designed to understand and generate human language. It is a class of neural network models trained on large amounts of text data, such as books, articles, and other written documents, to learn the statistical patterns and relationships between words and phrases in natural language.\n\nThe following video provides examples of LLMs.\n\n## What techniques do LLMs use?\n\nLLMs use various techniques to model language, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformers. These models are typically composed of many layers, with millions or even billions of parameters, allowing them to capture complex patterns in language and generate realistic and coherent text.\n\n## Examples of LLMs\n\nSeveral Large Language Models (LLMs) have been developed in recent years. Here are some of the most prominent ones:\n\n### GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3)\n\nIt is developed by OpenAI. GPT-3 is one of the largest and most advanced LLMs currently available. It has over 175 billion parameters. It is capable of generating highly coherent text. GPT-3 has been used for a wide range of applications, such as chatbots, content creation, and language translation.\n\n### ChatGPT\n\nThere has been a buzz around ChatGPT. Many confuse ChatGPT and GPT-3 to be the same. They are actually not the same. While ChatGPT and GPT-3 share similarities in their underlying architecture, they are distinct models with different characteristics. ChatGPT is designed specifically for conversational AI, while GPT-3 is a more general-purpose language model that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks.\n\n### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\n\nIt is developed by Google. BERT is a powerful LLM capable of understanding the context of words and phrases in natural language. It has been used for various applications, including question-answering and sentiment analysis. One of my Ph.D. students uses BERT-generated vectors in his research to create coherent stories from news articles.\n\n### XLNet (eXtreme MultiLingual Language Model)\n\nIt was developed by Carnegie Mellon University and Google. XLNet is an LLM that uses an autoregressive model to generate text. It can generate high-quality text in multiple languages and has been used for applications such as language translation and content creation.\n\n### T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)\n\nA lot of T’s, not really, five trees. Developed by Google, T5 is an LLM capable of generating a wide range of natural language outputs, including translation, summarization, and question-answering. It has been used for applications such as language modeling and conversational agents. A more advanced version of T5 is already released and is called T5X.\xa0\n\n### RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training Approach)\n\nAll big tech companies need an LLM nowadays, of course, having one brings prestige. So, Facebook, sorry, Meta, needs one too. Yes, Meta’s LLM is RoBERTa. RoBERTa is an LLM that builds on the BERT architecture to improve performance on various natural language processing tasks.\n\n## Strengths and Limitations of LLMs\n\nThese are just a few examples of the several LLMs that have been developed in recent years. Each of these models has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of model will depend on the specific application and task at hand. Please feel free to write more names of LLMs in the comments section below.\xa0\n\nThe main advantage of LLMs is their ability to generate natural language text that is contextually relevant and grammatically correct. This has led to the developing of applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, research summarization, and content creation tools. LLMs have also been used for advanced natural-language-processing tasks such as question-answering, text summarization, knowledge acquisition, and sentiment analysis.\n\nHowever, training LLMs requires vast amounts of text data and computing resources, which can be prohibitively expensive for many applications. LLMs can sometimes generate biased language, which can have negative consequences if not carefully monitored.\n\n## Responsible AI\n\nDespite these challenges, LLMs represent a significant breakthrough in natural language processing and are likely to impact many industries in the coming years profoundly. The utilization of LLMs in applications falls under Responsible AI, which refers to the ethical, transparent, and trustworthy development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. As machine learning researchers and practitioners, we should ensure that AI technologies are designed and implemented to align with human values and societal norms.\n\nEnjoy the beauty of artificial intelligence.\n\n* Share:\n\n[Shahriar](https://computing4all.com/author/shahriar-hossain/)\n\nI am a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso.

Understanding these categories is crucial for selecting appropriate benchmarks and interpreting results effectively:\n\n1. **Performance Benchmarks**: These benchmarks assess a model's ability to complete specific tasks effectively. They often include metrics such as accuracy, speed, and resource consumption (e.g., memory and processing power). For example, the GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark is widely recognized for evaluating performance across several natural language understanding tasks.\n\n2. **Capability Benchmarks**: These focus on a model's capacity to perform a broader range of tasks or to handle complex scenarios. The SuperGLUE benchmark, for instance, extends beyond basic performance metrics to evaluate models on tasks requiring reasoning, commonsense knowledge, and nuanced language understanding.\n\n3. **Effectiveness Benchmarks**: These benchmarks evaluate not only technical performance but also the practical applicability of models in real-world scenarios. This includes user satisfaction and the model's ability to generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses. Benchmarks aligned with user studies illustrate how well a model meets user needs in applications like customer service or content creation.\n\n4. **Robustness Benchmarks**: These assess a model's resilience to adversarial inputs or variations in data distribution. Robustness benchmarks are essential for identifying vulnerabilities, particularly as AI systems are deployed in unpredictable environments.\n\nBy recognizing the various types of benchmarks and their specific focus areas, researchers can better evaluate LLMs, guiding improvements and ensuring that models are both effective and trustworthy in their applications. \n\nIn summary, benchmarking serves as a foundational practice in AI, facilitating performance assessment and propelling the advancement of model capabilities and effectiveness in addressing real-world tasks.

it?\n\nBenchmarking is the process of comparing a company’s performance, products, or processes to those of its competitors or industry standards in order to identify areas for improvement and best practices.\n\nThis can involve analyzing key metrics such as sales, customer satisfaction, production efficiency, or cost-effectiveness to see how a company measures up to others in its industry. Benchmarking provides valuable insights that can help businesses set realistic goals, make informed decisions, and ultimately improve their overall performance and competitiveness.\n\nFor business people, benchmarking is crucial because it allows them to see how their company compares to others in the industry. By identifying strengths and weaknesses in comparison to competitors or industry standards, business leaders can make more informed decisions about where to allocate resources, which strategies to pursue, and where to focus improvement efforts.\n\nBenchmarking also helps businesses stay ahead of the curve by adopting best practices and learning from the successes and failures of others. Ultimately, benchmarking can lead to improved performance, increased efficiency, and a stronger competitive position in the market.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nBenchmarking in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the process of comparing the performance of different AI systems to determine which one is the most effective or efficient in a specific task or application.\n\nThink of benchmarking AI like comparing the performance of different brands of cars. You want to see which car has the best fuel efficiency, the fastest acceleration, or the smoothest handling. Similarly, in AI, we want to know which system can process data the fastest, make the most accurate predictions, or understand human language the best.\n\nTo benchmark an AI system, we typically set a standard task or problem and measure how well different AI models perform in solving it. For example, if we’re benchmarking AI chatbots, we might test their ability to understand and respond to different types of customer inquiries. The AI system that can handle the most diverse range of questions with the most accurate responses would be considered the best performer.\n\nBenchmarking helps businesses make informed decisions about which AI systems to invest in or use for specific tasks. It allows companies to compare and choose the most suitable AI solution based on their unique needs and goals.\n\n### Pros\n\n### Cons\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66faf094459c16fad4ecb09a/687802ba6ade19e7125d8f9f_Logo-AI-Explored-White.svg)\n\n## Applications and Examples\n\nBenchmarking is a term used in real-world scenarios to compare the performance of a product, service, or process to the best in the industry. For example, a company may use benchmarking to compare the efficiency of its production line to that of its competitors in order to identify areas for improvement. Another example is a hospital using benchmarking to compare patient outcomes and satisfaction with other hospitals in order to improve their own practices.\n\n## History and Evolution\n\nBenchmarking originated in the 1950s as a method for businesses to compare their performance against industry standards. It was popularized in the 1980s by Xerox Corporation, and became a widely adopted practice for improving efficiency and effectiveness. In the context of artificial intelligence, benchmarking is crucial for evaluating the performance and progress of AI systems, ensuring that they meet industry standards and continue to advance in capabilities.\n\nToday, benchmarking is essential for AI development as it allows researchers and developers to measure the performance of different AI models and algorithms. It provides a basis for comparing and improving AI technology, driving innovation and progress in the field. By setting and achieving benchmarks, the AI community is able to push the boundaries of what is possible and continue to advance the capabilities of AI.\n\n## FAQs\n\nBenchmarking in AI is the process of comparing the performance of different algorithms, models, or systems in order to assess their effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nBenchmarking allows researchers and developers to understand the capabilities and limitations of different AI technologies, helping to drive innovation and improvement in the field.\n\nIn AI research, benchmarking is used to measure and compare the performance of different AI systems on standardized tasks and datasets, providing valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nCommon benchmarks in AI include image recognition accuracy, language processing speed, and computational efficiency, which help to evaluate the performance of AI systems across different domains.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nBenchmarking originated in the 1950s as a method for businesses to compare their performance against industry standards.

Demand for both training and inference hardware [keeps growing](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Semiconductors/Our%20Insights/Artificial%20intelligence%20hardware%20New%20opportunities%20for%20semiconductor%20companies/Artificial-intelligence-hardware.ashx). Now several years into the great AI boom, Google Scholar and arXiv’s AI and Machine Learning-focused directories continue to [receive hundreds of new submissions](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/new) on a daily basis.\n\nYet the faster the landscape expands, the more questions the industry faces — proof that an abundance of choice isn’t always a good thing. How do the latest LLMs stack up? Who has the best video generation model? Which model is the fastest with a 100k-token prompt? Last but not least: how much will it cost you?\n\n**These questions are why benchmarking matters.** From the earliest ImageNet competitions to today’s complex language and reasoning tasks, benchmarks have been the invisible engine of AI advancement. They make progress legible, drive accountability, and help researchers, businesses, and policymakers alike speak a common language.\n\n**As models have grown from narrow classifiers to multimodal, reasoning, and even agentic systems, benchmarks have had to evolve in lockstep to more closely reflect the industry’s ever-changing focus.**\n\nThis piece explores AI benchmarking’s state of affairs: why it matters, who conducts it, and the challenges and opportunities at play.\n\n## What Is AI Benchmarking?\n\nBenchmarking is the practice of evaluating an AI system’s performance against standardized tests.\n\nA benchmark might be as simple as a dataset of labeled images or as complex as an interactive software environment. **What makes it a benchmark are its consistency** — every model faces the same challenge, under the same conditions, and produces results that can be compared across time and architectures — **and its transparency.**\n\nIn machine learning’s early days, benchmarks were narrow and task-specific — think image (e.g., [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/)) or speech recognition (e.g., [TIMIT](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93S1)), argument extraction (e.g., [TreeBank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T42)), and so on. These benchmarks defined the early vocabulary of progress in terms of accuracy, word error rate, and [cumulative rewards](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html#key-concepts-and-terminology).\n\nIn contrast, modern benchmarks are multidimensional: they assess reasoning, safety, latency, cost, and even energy efficiency. And **as the industry comes up with new questions, it continues to require new, more sophisticated benchmarks to answer them.**\n\n## Why AI Benchmarking Matters\n\n**Benchmarks are more than technical scoreboards.** Every breakthrough in AI, from the first convolutional networks to today’s frontier models, has relied on them to **quantify improvement, validate new ideas, and facilitate reproduction**. Without shared measurement, innovation would remain siloed and anecdotal and everyone would be left guessing whether a new architecture is genuinely more capable than its predecessors, rather than simply different. By making results public and comparable, benchmarks instead enable positive feedback loops to form.\n\nAt the end of the day, benchmarking is a tool. As such, **it can be used at different stages, from research, to production, to industry-wide governance**. Let’s cover each in turn.\n\n### Research\n\nBenchmarks enable researchers in a number of ways:\n\n* They enable **comparison** through metrics rather than claims.\n* They encourage **iteration**: When experiments are run against the same test suite, labs can isolate with precision which architectural choices or training methods actually drive improvement.\n* They foster **reproducibility**: Public benchmarks turn one lab’s results into a foundation that others can build upon. Air Street Capital’s [State of AI Report 2025](https://www.stateof.ai/) highlights this dynamic clearly: standardized evaluation “turns fragmented experimentation into collective progress.”\n* They democratize **discovery** for smaller labs and independent researchers, who get access to the same insights as their deep-pocketed peers.\n\nTogether, these traits mean **innovation happens faster, for less, and spreads more widely.**\n\n### Production\n\n**Benchmarks also underpin the practical side of AI**: performance, efficiency, and cost. When you’re processing millions of requests and billions of tokens, every percentage point across any one of those metrics matters. Benchmarking allows companies big and small to access standardized measurements when deciding which hardware, model, or API endpoint to deploy.\n\nAs the space gets more crowded, **providers have put applicability front and center**. [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/), for instance, [emphasizes](https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology) that its “benchmark results are not intended to represent the maximum possible performance on any particular hardware platform, they are intended to represent the real-world performance customers experience across providers.”\n\nBenchmarking is also central to the product development process, helping developers and product teams validate their own workflows and assess their products’ performance before general availability or regulatory review. This makes internal benchmarks an indispensable complement to the external-facing tool that are user tests.\n\n### Governance and Safety\n\nFinally, benchmarks are becoming the foundation for AI governance. In recent years, **the rapid increase in the technology’s capabilities has raised concerns over the potential risks of its implementation.** Newly formed regulatory bodies are now tasked with everything from risk categorization, to defining security, transparency, and quality obligations, to conducting conformity assessments. The tracker maintained by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) — last updated in May 2025 — [shows extensive global activity](https://iapp.org/resources/article/global-ai-legislation-tracker/), with over 75 jurisdictions having introduced AI-related laws or policies to date.\n\nWith that in mind, **regulators are increasingly using benchmarks to understand what a model can do before it’s deployed**. In particular, they are interested in identifying its behavioral propensities, including a model’s tendency to hallucinate or the reliability of its performance. The UK’s [AI Security Institute (AISI)](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/), for example, runs independent evaluations of advanced models, assessing areas like biosecurity, cybersecurity, and persuasion capabilities. Its work has set a precedent for government-backed model testing, complementing internal lab efforts and introducing a form of “public audit” for AI safety.\n\n## Who Does AI Benchmarking Today?\n\nThe more central benchmarking became, the more stakeholders started getting involved in hope of **shaping the industry’s key metrics and practices**. Today, a wide range of actors provides the industry with the information it needs, including:\n\n* **Academic and non-profit initiatives**: Projects like Stanford’s [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/) (Holistic Evaluation of Language Model) and [METR](https://metr.org/) (Model Evaluation and Threat Research) drive the scientific backbone of benchmarking. HELM focuses on transparent, open, reproducible evaluations. METR, by contrast, looks at long-horizon and agentic tasks — how well models perform multi-step reasoning or sustain a plan over time.\n* **Private providers**: A segment of independent analytics and benchmarking companies has emerged to meet the growing need for consistent, business-grade comparisons. Today, providers like Artificial Analysis test commercial systems across intelligence, speed, and pricing. This professionalization of benchmarking signals a maturing market where transparent, repeatable testing becomes a service in and of itself.\n* **Internal benchmarks**: While companies widely use public, open benchmarks, they also [conduct their own testing](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ai-llama-models-training-data-ablation-2025-4). Internal benchmarking enables teams to create bespoke metrics and yardsticks before a dedicated public benchmark exists. It also supports tighter feedback loops between measurement and implementation, which can help shorten time to market. For example, at Scaleway, we use internal tests to bulletproof our PaaS solutions.\n* **Industry consortia**: The MLCommons community runs MLPerf, a leading hardware and deployment benchmark. Originally focused on training workloads, it now emphasizes inference benchmarks, including LLMs, with standardized metrics for performance per watt or dollar. MLCommons’s [board of directors](https://mlcommons.org/about-us/leadership/) includes leaders from manufacturers like Intel, Nvidia, Graphcore, and others.\n* **Safety and government evaluators**: As mentioned, AI-related legislation has spawned a number of new regulatory bodies tasked with testing frontier models for national and public safety. The UK’s AISI’s early findings have notably called for shared, cross-lab methodologies to test AI’s biosecurity, cyber, and persuasion capabilities.\n* **Crowd leaderboards**: With its intuitive chatbot interface, the [LMSYS Arena](https://lmarena.ai/) has become the public face of model comparison, allowing users to rank AI assistants through anonymous pairwise voting.\n\n**Together, these initiatives form an invaluable but increasingly complex — and sometimes contradictory — ecosystem.**\n\n## AI Benchmarking’s Challenges…\n\nEven as benchmarking becomes more sophisticated, it faces growing pains — Airstreet Capital’s [State of AI Report 2025](https://www.stateof.ai/) highlighted that the field’s rapid expansion has outpaced the robustness of its measurements. In no particular order, below are some of its current challenges.\n\n* **Data contamination and repeat exposure**: Popular benchmarks have become victims of their own success. Public datasets are widely circulated, meaning portions of test material often end up in model training data. When that happens, performance scores can reflect memory rather than reasoning, creating a false impression of progress.\n* **Variance and reproducibility**: Some reasoning and math benchmarks contain so few questions that results can swing significantly based on random seed or prompt phrasing. Without multiple runs or confidence intervals, it’s difficult to know whether performance gains are real or statistical noise.\n* **Eval-aware behavior**: The most advanced models are not just performing better; they are also starting to recognize when they’re being tested. “Eval-aware” models can change tone, verbosity, or refusal behaviors to optimize for benchmark success without improving underlying reasoning. This means evaluators may need to adopt stealthier approaches to ensure authentic behavior under evaluation. [MLPerf’s training rules](https://github.com/mlcommons/training_policies/blob/master/training_rules.adoc#mlperf-training-rules), for example, make it clear that “the framework and system should not detect and behave differently for benchmarks.”\n* **Fragmentation across evaluators**: Between private providers, non-profits, crowd sourcing, and governmental evaluators, benchmarking as a field is getting increasingly crowded. While this diversity fuels innovation, it also fragments compatibility — without a common baseline, it’s easy for models to look stronger or weaker depending on which benchmark suite is chosen. More cross-lab coordination and standardized protocols may be needed.\n* **Partial coverage**: For all the diversity in today’s benchmarking ecosystem, benchmarks still only effectively cover part of the AI. Evaluating hardware or models is essentially a solved problem; assessing processes or code architecture, not so much. Context-specific performance remains evasive — a challenge considering how companies are now trying to apply AI to increasingly specific verticals. **Now, agents represent yet another hurdle**. If agentic systems are to become the industry’s new default UI, benchmarks will need to adapt accordingly.\n* **“Tunnel vision” evaluation**: As AI regulation becomes more of a priority, benchmarking is showing its limits. Researchers from Sapienza University of Rome, DEXAI-Artificial Ethics, and Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies pointed out that current benchmarks “were not designed to measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape” — a situation they described as the [“benchmark-regulation gap.”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05464) They found that “the evaluation ecosystem dedicates the vast majority of its focus to a narrow set of behavioral propensities” while neglecting “capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios, including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI development.”\n\n## … And Opportunities\n\nWhile the above challenges need to be addressed, we should remain optimistic: positive trends are developing that should make benchmarking more useful and reliable, not less. Here are a few of them:\n\n* **Improving transparency**: Independent providers like Artificial Analysis and projects like HELP or MLPerf are setting a new bar for open methodology, releasing full prompt logs, evaluation seeds, and configuration details that allow any lab to audit and reproduce their results. These groups apply the same “open-door” approach to their blogs, publishing [full sets of questions](https://metr.org/blog/2025-06-27-risk-transparency/), responses to upcoming legislation or private frameworks, and more. Together, these efforts ensure that the culture of benchmarking leans towards openness, rather than secrecy.\n* **Positive scrutiny**: They say to solve a problem, you must first acknowledge it. Beyond pointing at structural issues, [a number](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.12990v1#S7) [of](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.06559v1) [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05464) have aimed to provide new frameworks for evaluating benchmarks — benchmarking the benchmarkers, if you will. Stanford, for instance, unveiled [BetterBench](https://betterbench.stanford.edu/), “a living repository of benchmark assessments to support benchmark comparability.” Overall, this growing (but positive) scrutiny should help improve benchmark design and usability.\n* **Future-proofing**: Long gone are the days of narrow benchmarking. With the rise of multimodal, reasoning, and now even agentic systems, providers continue to come up with new benchmarks to ensure their work reflects AI’s new capabilities and the industry’s evolving needs. Notable metrics include measuring a model’s [“task completion time horizon”](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/?) — the length of tasks AI agents can complete —, [long-term coherence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15840), or [cultural inclusivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09595). Meanwhile, practices such as periodic dataset revisions and the addition of new scenarios ensure that benchmarking remains as dynamic as the ecosystem it’s meant to monitor.\n* **Growing collaboration**: Despite stark competition for customers’ attention and spending, the industry’s various stakeholders are increasingly collaborating on shared protocols. For example, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have all participated in [joint safety evaluations under the UK’s AISI supervision](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/uk-ai-safety-research-pledge/), giving early or priority access to their models for research and safety purposes. Meanwhile, with its 125+ founding Members and Affiliates all working towards a shared goal of open industry-standard benchmarks, MLCommons stands as perhaps the best example of industry-wide collaboration.\n\nWe look forward to seeing how these developments impact the industry for the better!\n\n## Where AI Benchmarking Is Going Next\n\n**From its early, task-specific beginnings, benchmarking has evolved into vital infrastructure for the entire field of AI.** Today, the combined efforts of the public and private sectors provide the industry with continuously updated data and insights. Benchmarks enable comparison, encourage iteration, and drive discovery, ensuring that competition ultimately benefits everyone.\n\n**As the field matures, what we measure may increasingly determine what we build**. With concerns over AI safety rising, regulators are relying on benchmarking more and more for practical decision-making, while companies are turning to it for transparency and trust.\n\nAt Scaleway, benchmarking is equally central to how we operate. For example, it helps guide the roadmap for our [Generative APIs](https://www.scaleway.com/en/generative-apis/), ensuring we [integrate only battle-tested models](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/generative-apis/#whisper-large-v3-is-now-available) with proven real-world applicability.\n\nBut this relationship also flows the other way: we actively contribute to the benchmarking ecosystem. Our API inference endpoint will soon be featured on Artificial Analysis, giving researchers and businesses direct visibility into our own performance. It’s a small but meaningful step toward greater transparency — a reflection of our continued focus on transparency.\n\n  \n \n\n---\n\n   \n\n**ai-PULSE, Europe’s premier Artificial Intelligence conference powered by Scaleway, is returning!**\n\nGathering key players from across Europe, the event will be back once again at **STATION F on December 4** for a unique blend of deep technical expertise and crucial business insights.

The process of LLM benchmarking plays a central role in evaluating these models' effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability to real-world tasks. By systematically comparing LLMs against standardized tasks and metrics, stakeholders can gauge a model's strengths and weaknesses, guiding the development of more sophisticated and capable language models.\xa0  \n\xa0  \nFor businesses, the benefits of LLM benchmarking extend beyond mere technical evaluation. Benchmarking provides a foundation for strategic decision-making, enabling companies to select the most suitable models for their specific applications. Whether for enhancing customer service through chatbots or improving content generation, the insights gained from benchmarking can drive innovation, optimize operational efficiencies, and create competitive advantages in the marketplace.\n\nCrucially, LLM benchmarking facilitates informed product development decisions. By understanding how different LLMs perform on various tasks and metrics, businesses can tailor their development efforts to address specific needs, prioritize features that offer the most value, and allocate resources more effectively.\n\n## Key metrics for LLM benchmarking\n\nIdentifying the right metrics is fundamental to effective LLM benchmarking. These metrics should comprehensively cover aspects of LLM performance, including but not limited to:\n\n* **Accuracy:** How well the model’s output matches the expected result\n* **Latency and throughput:** How efficiently the model processes input and generates output\n* **Ability:** How well the model generates coherent and contextually relevant responses\n\nTogether, these metrics provide a holistic view of an LLM’s capabilities.\n\nWhen comparing language models, it's necessary to evaluate them based on:\n\n* **Accuracy:** Ensures the model's outputs are reliable and relevant\n* **Efficiency:** Measures the model's speed and resource consumption\n* **Scalability:** Assesses the model's performance stability under varying loads\n\nThese dimensions are critical for businesses that require high-performing, cost-effective, and scalable solutions for their AI-driven applications.\n\nEvaluating LLM features at scale necessitates advanced tools and methodologies. Tools that can automate the evaluation process, handle large datasets, and simulate real-world scenarios are invaluable. They enable businesses to conduct thorough LLM evaluations, ensuring that the chosen models can meet demands for high-quality, efficient, and scalable language processing capabilities. This comprehensive evaluation process is essential for leveraging the full potential of [generative AI](/insights/ai-and-machine-learning/the-generative-ai-technology-stack) in business applications.\n\n## Challenges and limitations of LLM benchmarking\n\nOne significant challenge is the dynamic nature of language itself, which can lead to benchmarks that quickly become outdated as language use evolves. Additionally, due to the complexity and diversity of tasks that LLMs are expected to perform, no single benchmark can adequately capture a model's overall capabilities. This necessitates a suite of benchmarks to evaluate different aspects of LLM performance comprehensively.\n\nBenchmarking methodologies can also introduce biases and pitfalls that skew the evaluation of LLMs. For instance, benchmarks might favor models trained on specific types of data or those optimized for particular metrics, such as accuracy, at the expense of other important factors, like fairness or robustness. Recognizing and addressing these biases is essential for objective and reliable model comparisons. This involves designing benchmarks that are inclusive and representative of the diverse range of tasks and contexts in which LLMs operate.\n\nEnsuring fair and reliable comparisons among different LLMs requires a standardized approach to benchmarking. Variations in how models are tested and evaluated can lead to inconsistent and misleading results. Establishing common benchmarking protocols and metrics allows for more accurate comparisons, facilitating the identification of the most effective models for specific applications. This standardization is a critical step toward advancing the field of LLMs and maximizing their utility in real-world applications.\n\n## Best practices for LLM benchmarking\n\nBest practices in LLM benchmarking are vital for achieving accurate and reliable results. Carefully select benchmarks relevant to the specific tasks the LLM will perform to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the model's capabilities. Use diverse datasets to test the model across a wide range of scenarios, minimizing the risk of bias and ensuring the model's robustness and versatility.\n\nCreate standardized frameworks for LLM evaluation to significantly enhance the benchmarking process. Frameworks provide consistent guidelines for conducting benchmarks, analyzing results, and reporting findings. They facilitate comparisons across different LLMs by ensuring that all models are evaluated under the same conditions and according to the same criteria. Standardized frameworks also help with identifying areas where models excel or need improvement, guiding future development efforts.\n\nCollaboration among experts in the field is necessary for establishing and refining benchmarking standards. By pooling knowledge and resources, the [AI/ML](/insights/ai-and-machine-learning) community can develop more sophisticated and comprehensive benchmarks that accurately reflect the complexities of natural language processing tasks. This collaborative approach also promotes the sharing of best practices and innovations in LLM evaluation, driving the continuous improvement of benchmarking methodologies and the development of more advanced and capable language models.\n\n## LLM leaderboards unlock business success\n\nThe significance of LLM leaderboards extends beyond mere rankings. They serve as benchmarking tools that provide valuable insights into the capabilities and performance of various language models. By participating in open LLM leaderboards, businesses can gauge how their models stack up against the competition, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. This competitive analysis can inform strategic decisions, from refining model architectures to optimizing training datasets, ultimately enhancing the model's performance and business utility.\n\nCompanies looking to leverage generative AI technologies should understand the business benefits of participating in LLM leaderboards:\n\n* High rankings on reputable leaderboards can serve as a mark of excellence, boosting a company's reputation in the AI community and attracting potential customers, partners, and talent\n* The process of preparing for and participating in leaderboard challenges can drive internal innovation, encouraging teams to push the boundaries of what their models can achieve\n\nTo improve language model performance and rankings on LLM leaderboards, adopt a strategy of technical optimization and strategic planning.

In collaboration with top universities, we developed [Beemo](https://toloka.ai/blog/toloka-and-top-universities-launch-innovative-benchmark-for-detecting-ai-generated-texts/), an advanced benchmark for detecting AI-generated text. It’s a vital tool for identifying and evaluating synthetic content that can be used in training datasets. Additionally, Toloka assessed LLM performance across [natural sciences](https://toloka.ai/blog/are-llms-good-at-natural-science/), creating a detailed benchmark spanning ten subject areas to evaluate model accuracy and reliability in complex scientific contexts.\n\n###### **Read more in Toloka’s blog posts on** [**Beemo**](https://toloka.ai/blog/toloka-and-top-universities-launch-innovative-benchmark-for-detecting-ai-generated-texts/) **and** [**natural sciences benchmark**](https://toloka.ai/blog/are-llms-good-at-natural-science/)**.**\n\nAs the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) expand, the need for robust, nuanced, and domain-specific benchmarks is more critical than ever. Benchmarks are crucial in measuring these models' performance, safety, and alignment with intended tasks. They help developers and researchers assess whether LLMs meet the demands of real-world applications. This article will delve into LLM benchmarking, benchmark datasets, and the pioneering datasets Toloka is developing to address specific challenges in AI.\n\n## What is LLM benchmarking?\n\nBenchmarking of an LLM is the process of evaluating large language models and comparing performance metrics to measure their performance in specific tasks or domains. Evaluating LLMs involves metrics or scorers to assess performance. They offer a standardized way to compare model outputs.\n\nThis assessment also involves using carefully designed datasets, which are also called benchmarks, and contain tasks intended to highlight a model’s strengths and weaknesses. These benchmarks (metrics and datasets) help developers understand how well their LLMs perform in areas like language comprehension, factual accuracy, reasoning, and even specialized fields like mathematics or natural sciences.\n\n## Why is it essential for LLM evaluation?\n\nLarge language model evaluation through benchmarks ensures that these models are accurate, dependable, and well-suited to users' and industries' needs. It’s a key part of developing helpful and responsible AI. Evaluating LLMs is essential because it clearly shows how well these models perform, where they may fall short, and how they can be improved.\n\n### Uncovering weaknesses and errors\n\nBenchmarks help identify areas where LLMs may produce inaccurate or misleading information, such as hallucinations that are factually incorrect model responses. They can also show where the model struggles with complex reasoning or inconsistencies in specialized knowledge domains. These issues can go unnoticed without systematic evaluation, potentially leading to trust issues or unintended consequences in future applications.\n\n### Improving models where it matters\n\nThe evaluation highlights specific weaknesses, making it easier to make improvements. Based on these findings, developers can fine-tune models to boost accuracy in areas that need it most. For instance, if a model has trouble with scientific concepts or math reasoning, targeted training data can help fill those gaps.\n\n### Ensuring models are useful across various domains\n\nGeneral-purpose LLMs often underperform in specialized areas like medicine, law, or technical. Specialized benchmarks help developers check whether their models are ready for real-world use in these domains, making them safer and more reliable for professionals who need accuracy.\n\n### Building responsible and ethical AI\n\nReliable benchmarking helps ensure that models follow ethical guidelines, such as detecting bias, keeping content authentic, and identifying AI-generated text when needed. This helps build models that are accurate and aligned with ethical standards, ultimately building trust.\n\n### Adapting models to changing Information\n\nBenchmarks help keep LLMs relevant in rapidly changing fields. For instance, models used in medicine or finance need constant updating to stay accurate with new research or policies. Regular benchmarking highlights areas where models might rely on outdated information so developers can keep them current.\n\n## How LLM benchmarks work\n\nLLM benchmarks offer a structured way to evaluate and compare language models on various tasks. Benchmarks work by defining specific tasks or skill areas that are relevant to understanding the capabilities of LLMs. Here are some core tasks benchmarks commonly assess:\n\n**Language generation and conversation.** Measures the model’s ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant responses to prompts or questions, essential for tasks like creative writing and chat-based dialogue;\n\n**Understanding and answering questions.** Evaluates the model’s skill in interpreting text and producing accurate, relevant answers. This is crucial for information retrieval tasks and question-answering systems;\n\n**Translation.** Tests the model's ability to translate between languages with fluency and accuracy, allowing models to handle multilingual tasks;\n\n**Logical reasoning and common sense.** Involves tasks that test the model’s ability to use logic, reasoning, and everyday knowledge to solve problems. This can include both inductive and deductive reasoning challenges.\n\n**Standardized tests.** Benchmarks may include tasks modeled after human exams like the SAT, ACT, and other standardized assessments, offering insight into how well an LLM mimics human learning and reasoning abilities.\n\n**Code generation.** Assesses the model’s capability to understand programming-related tasks and generate functional code. This task area is essential for evaluating models aimed at supporting software development.\n\n## Evaluation strategies\n\nThere are two basic strategies for LLM evaluation: offline and online evaluation. The offline approach involves testing LLM performance in a controlled setting before deployment. It’s a reliable way to identify and address weaknesses without exposing end-users to errors.\n\nOnce the model is live, online evaluation helps monitor its ongoing performance during real-world use. This feedback loop ensures the model meets quality standards and adapts to evolving user needs.\n\n## Benchmarking metrics\n\nBenchmarking metrics are the scoring criteria used to grade the model’s performance. They tell us how well a model performs on specific tasks and where it might need improvement. Because human language is very complex and diverse, many approaches and metrics exist for evaluating LLMs. These metrics range from straightforward statistics-based scores to more specialized scorers, even involving LLMs that can evaluate other models (LLM-assisted evaluation).\n\n### Types of metrics\n\nAlthough there is no single classification of LLM evaluation approaches, the following types of metrics can be singled out.\n\n#### Basic statistical metrics\n\nSome simpler metrics focus on direct comparisons, such as counting common word patterns or sequences. BLEU and ROUGE are examples often used for tasks like translation and summarization, where matching specific phrases and structures matters.\n\n#### Contextual or domain-specific scorers\n\nOther metrics, like METEOR or BLEURT, consider context, tone, and meaning, allowing for a more human-like evaluation beyond word-for-word matching. Domain-specific scorers measure performance in specialized fields like code generation or complex reasoning, focusing on whether a model can fulfill specific requirements accurately, as seen in benchmarks like HumanEval for coding.\n\n#### LLM-Assisted Evaluation\n\nIn some cases, newer LLMs act as judges to evaluate the outputs of other models, simulating human judgment. Advanced models like GPT-4 can assess criteria such as relevance or helpfulness, which is especially useful for complex tasks like dialogue or multi-turn questions.\n\n### The importance of golden datasets\n\nBehind almost all these scorers lies a golden dataset with high-quality examples and accurate answers for various tasks. Much like a human learns and gets certified in a field, these datasets guide LLMs during training, fine-tuning, and benchmarking, ensuring they have a well-defined reference to meet real-world standards.\n\nThe following are some widely used LLM benchmarks or metrics and what they measure.\n\n## Common LLM benchmarks\n\n* **Accuracy or precision** measures how often the model's answers are correct;\n* **Recall** shows how well the model captures all the relevant instances, or in other words, it tells us how good the model is at finding everything it's supposed to find;\n* **F1 Score** is a balance of precision and recall, giving a single number showing how well the model finds and correctly identifies the positive answers. It is beneficial when there is a mix of right and wrong answers;\n* **Perplexity** is used for language tasks; perplexity checks how well the model predicts the next word in a sentence. Lower perplexity means it’s better at making text sound natural;\n* **Exact Match (EM)** is a metric used to measure how often a model’s prediction exactly matches the correct answer;\n* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** is an algorithm that scores the similarity between a model-generated text and one or more reference texts, typically using n-gram precision as its core evaluation method.\n* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)** is a set of metrics and software often used to evaluate summarization tasks by measuring the overlap between model-generated and reference summaries. It primarily evaluates recall, meaning how much of the reference text appears in the model’s output;\n* **METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering)** is an automatic metric that uses exact matches, synonyms, stemming, and word order to measure similarity, allowing for more varied, human-like phrasing in the model’s output. It improves by calculating both precision (n-gram matches) and recall (n-gram overlaps) between the model's output and reference text;\n* **BLEURT (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy with Representations from Transformers)** is an automatic metric that leverages pre-trained Transformer models such as BERT to assess the similarity between generated and reference texts.\n\n## Benchmarking datasets\n\nBenchmarking datasets are data collections like questions or tasks used to test and train LLMs on specific abilities or knowledge areas. Unlike generic training datasets, which help the model learn, benchmarking datasets are designed to probe the model’s strengths and weaknesses in targeted areas.\n\nThey often cover a range of tasks, which helps test models in different scenarios. These might include everything from simple classification tasks to more complex activities like logical reasoning or creative generation.\n\n### Some widely used datasets to benchmark LLM\n\n* **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)** is a benchmark that tests LLMs’ ability to perform well across a large variety of tasks simultaneously, reflecting how models handle general knowledge and domain-specific questions. MMLU includes questions from 57 domains, starting from basic subjects like math and history to more specialized fields such as law or medicine. It’s structured as a multiple-choice dataset, where each question has four possible answers;\n* **HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)** evaluates models from multiple angles, providing a holistic view of performance. It uses established datasets to assess accuracy and performance across various tasks and integrates qualitative reviews to capture subtleties in the model's responses. HELM also conducts error analysis to pinpoint specific areas where a model may struggle;\n* **GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)** is a comprehensive NLP benchmark comprising nine key tasks, each designed to test different aspects of language understanding, such as sentence classification, sentiment analysis, and question answering. For each task, GLUE provides a training set to train models, a development set for fine-tuning and adjusting model parameters, and an evaluation set to assess final performance;\n* **HellaSwag** is a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate commonsense reasoning and contextual understanding in LLMs. Unlike standard multiple-choice tasks, HellaSwag presents models with a context and several possible continuations, but only one of these continuations is truly logical based on the given context;\n* **MATH** is a specialized benchmark dataset consisting of 12,500 challenging mathematics problems, primarily sourced from high-school level and competition math. The dataset is designed to assess and advance the problem-solving and mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs;\n* **HumanEval** is a benchmark dataset that evaluates the ability of large language models to generate functional code. It consists of 164 programming tasks, each paired with a problem description and a function signature but without the complete solution.\n\n## Toloka’s approach to benchmarking\n\nToloka's approach to LLM benchmarking centers on evaluating models in areas where they are most vulnerable. Recent research by our team identified critical domains like AI-generated content detection, university-level math, and science-related domains as priority areas for improvement.\n\nSpecialized targeted benchmarks were developed at Toloka to help LLM developers assess their models' performance in these vulnerable domains. This initiative has led to the creation of three benchmarks, each designed to uncover specific performance gaps in language models.\n\nToloka utilizes an AI benchmarking evaluation method that measures models' performance on specific tasks using tailored datasets to address the challenges facing popular language models. This approach allows LLM producers to identify gaps in their models' capabilities and assess whether additional fine-tuning with supplementary data may be necessary to improve accuracy and alignment.\n\n### A tool for reliable AI-generated text detection\n\nOne essential benchmark Toloka developed is Beemo, a tool for detecting AI-generated text, which is crucial for ensuring data quality in LLM training. Beemo is unique in that it combines AI-generated and human-edited text within one dataset.\n\n### University-level math benchmark\n\nDespite advancements in LLMs, their reasoning abilities remain limited, particularly for complex subjects like mathematics. While many existing benchmarks assess basic math skills, they primarily focus on school-level problems, leaving a considerable gap in evaluating how LLMs handle more advanced, university-level questions.\n\nTo address this, Toloka developed the largest benchmark of its kind, featuring 20,000 real-world university-level math problems. This dataset allows for a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs’ mathematical reasoning, logical progression, and problem-solving skills at an advanced academic level.\n\n### Benchmarking for natural science LLMs\n\nIn response to the need for accurate assessments of LLMs in science-related areas, Toloka developed a specialized dataset that spans multiple scientific domains. Many existing datasets lack the complexity to evaluate models on the challenging questions scientists encounter in their work.\n\nTo fill this gap, Toloka collaborated with domain experts who were actively researching fields like high-energy physics, immunology, and cell biology.\n\n## How to use benchmarking datasets\n\nTo get the most out of benchmarking datasets, it's important to choose tasks and metrics that align well with what the model is expected to accomplish. For example, if the model is designed for customer support, it should be evaluated on datasets that reflect typical customer inquiries and responses.\n\nThe metrics should measure accuracy and criteria like the relevance and coherence of the responses. A mix of benchmarks that tap into different skills LLM might need in the real world are usually employed to assess a language model's capabilities comprehensively.\n\nBenchmark datasets typically consist of structured questions or prompts and gold-standard answers across a wide range of topics and complexity levels. First, the model runs through these tasks, and its responses are recorded for comparison against the benchmark answers.\n\nAfter the model completes the tasks, each benchmark provides specific scoring metrics designed for that type of content, such as accuracy, coherence, or relevance. These scores clearly show the model's performance across different skills or knowledge areas. By comparing results with other models, these benchmarks help to spot strengths, identify improvement areas, and guide further tuning.\n\nSuch datasets help systematically evaluate a model's performance and highlight its strengths and areas needing improvement. Developers can gain valuable insights into refining their models for better performance by carefully choosing tasks that align with their goals and looking closely at the results.\n\nThis thoughtful approach enhances the model’s capabilities and builds trust in the technology as it adapts to meet user needs. Ultimately, investing time in benchmarking can lead to more innovative and practical applications of AI.\n\nSubscribe to Toloka News\n\nCase studies, product news, and other articles straight to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\n[Back to top](./#attributes)\n\n### Recent articles\n\n[View all articles](../)\n\n[Essential AI agent guardrails for safe and ethical implementation\n\nOct 24, 2025](../essential-ai-agent-guardrails-for-safe-and-ethical-implementation/)[AI Deployment essentials: from clean data to continuous model monitoring\n\nOct 23, 2025](../ai-deployment-essentials-from-clean-data-to-continuous-model-monitoring/)[Toloka podcast: How RL Gyms are redefining data for AI agents\n\nOct 21, 2025](../toloka-podcast-how-rl-gyms-are-redefining-data-for-ai-agents/)\n\n### More about Toloka\n\nWhat is Toloka’s mission?\n\nWhere is Toloka located?\n\nWhat is Toloka’s key area of expertise?\n\nHow long has Toloka been in the AI market?\n\nHow does Toloka ensure the quality and accuracy of the data collected?\n\nHow does Toloka source and manage its experts and AI tutors?\n\nWhat types of projects or tasks does Toloka typically handle?\n\nWhat industries and use cases does Toloka focus on?\n\nSOLUTIONS\n\n[Data for AI agents](../../agent-data)\n\n[RL-Gyms for AI Agents](../../virtual-environments-rl-gyms)\n\n[Data for text & reasoning skils](../../large-language-models)\n\n[Data for Coding Models](../../coding-data)\n\n[Data for creative AI](../../creative-data)\n\n[AI Evaluation](../../evaluation)\n\n[AI Safety & Red Teaming](../../ai-safety)\n\n[Human - synthetic data](../../hybrid-data)\n\n[Meet our experts](../../experts)\n\nDATASETS\n\n[Off-the-shelf Datasets](../../datasets/)\n\n[Multimodal Conversations](../../datasets/multimodal-dataset)\n\n[University-level Math Reasoning](../../datasets/university-level-math-reasoning-dataset)\n\nRESEARCH\n\n[Toloka Research](../../research)\n\n[Responsible AI](../../responsible-ai)\n\n[AI text detection](../../ai-detection-benchmark)\n\n[Math reasoning](../../math-benchmark)\n\n[VQA benchmark](../../jeem-benchmark)\n\n[Case Studies](../../success-stories)\n\n[Security and Privacy](../../security)\n\nCompany\n\n[About Us](../../about)\n\n[Brand Guidelines](../../guidelines)\n\n© 2025 Toloka AI BV\n\nManage cookies\n\n[Privacy Notice](https://toloka.ai/legal/confidential/)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://toloka.ai/legal/customeragreement/)\n\n[Code of Conduct](https://toloka.ai/legal/codeofconduct/)\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Cookies give you a personalised experience\n\nWe are gathering cookies to ensure you get the best experience at Toloka.

These benchmarks include sample datasets, a series of questions or tasks that assess specific skills, performance metrics, and a scoring system to measure results.\n\nModels are evaluated based on their capabilities in areas such as coding, common sense reasoning, and natural language processing tasks like machine translation, question answering, and text summarization.\n\nLLM benchmarks are essential for the development and refinement of models. They track an LLM’s progress through quantitative metrics that highlight its strengths and areas for improvement, guiding the fine-tuning process. This supports researchers and developers in advancing the field. Additionally, benchmarks offer an objective comparison of different models, assisting software developers and organizations in selecting the most suitable models for their needs.\n\n\u200d\n\n## How LLM benchmarks work\n\n#### LLM benchmarks operate in a clear and straightforward manner. They present a task for an LLM to complete, evaluate the model’s performance using specific metrics, and generate a score based on those metrics. Here’s a detailed look at each step:\n\n### Setting Up\n\nLLM benchmarks come with pre-prepared sample data, such as coding challenges, extensive documents, math problems, real-world conversations, and science questions. A variety of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, problem-solving, question answering, summary generation, and translation, are provided to the model at the beginning of testing.\n\n### Testing\n\nDuring benchmarking, models are evaluated in one of three ways:**\u200d**\n\n**Few-shot:** The LLM is given a small number of examples demonstrating how to perform a task before it is prompted to complete the task. This evaluates the model’s ability to learn with limited data.\n\n**Zero-shot:** The LLM is prompted to complete a task without any prior examples. This tests the model’s ability to comprehend new concepts and adapt to novel scenarios.\n\n**Fine-tuned:** The model is trained on a dataset similar to the benchmark tasks, aiming to enhance the LLM’s performance on specific tasks associated with the benchmark.\n\n### Scoring\n\nAfter testing, the benchmark calculates how closely a model’s output matches the expected solution or standard answer, generating a score typically between 0 and 100.\n\n\u200d\n\n## Key metrics for benchmarking LLMs\n\n#### Different metrics are applied to evaluate the performance of LLMs. Here are some common ones:\n\n**Accuracy or Precision** calculates the percentage of correct predictions.\n\n**Recall,** also known as sensitivity rate, quantifies the number of true positives–the actual correct predictions.\n\n**F1 Score** combines accuracy and recall into one metric, considering both measures to balance any false positives or false negatives. F1 scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating excellent recall and precision.\n\n**Exact Match** measures the proportion of predictions that exactly match the expected outcome, particularly useful for tasks like translation and question answering.\n\n**Perplexity** assesses a model's predictive accuracy. Lower perplexity scores indicate better comprehension of a task.\n\n**Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)** evaluates machine translation by calculating the matching n-grams (a sequence of n-adjacent text symbols) between the model's translation and a human reference.\n\n**Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)** measures text summarization with several variants. ROUGE-N is similar to BLEU for summaries, while ROUGE-L computes the longest common subsequence between the model-generated summary and the human reference.\n\nTypically, these quantitative metrics are combined for a more comprehensive and robust assessment.\n\nHuman evaluation, on the other hand, involves qualitative metrics such as coherence, relevance, and semantic meaning. While human assessors can provide a nuanced evaluation, this process can be labor-intensive, subjective, and time-consuming. Therefore, a balance of both quantitative and qualitative metrics is essential for a thorough evaluation.\n\n\u200d\n\n## Limitations of LLM benchmarks\n\n#### While benchmarks are strong indicators of LLM performance, they cannot fully predict how a model will function in real-world scenarios. Here are a few constraints of LLM benchmarks:\n\n**Bounded Scoring:** Once a model achieves the highest possible score on a benchmark, the benchmark must be updated with more challenging tasks to remain a useful measure.\n\n**Broad Dataset:** LLM benchmark often use sample data from a wide range of subjects and tasks, which may not be suitable for edge cases, specialized areas, or specific use cases.\n\n**Finite Assessments:** Benchmarks can only evaluate a model's current capabilities. As LLMs evolve and develop new abilities, new benchmarks will be necessary.\n\n**Overfitting:**\xa0Training an LLM on the same dataset used for benchmarking can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on test data but poorly on real-world data. This results in a score that does not accurately reflect the model's true capabilities.\n\n**Aggregate Scoring:** Some benchmarks, like the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), report only aggregate scores without breaking down performance by subject. This lack of granularity can obscure specific areas where a model excels or needs improvement, making it harder to identify strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\u200d\n\n## What are LLM\xa0leaderboards?\n\nLLM leaderboards rank large language models based on their performance across various benchmarks. These leaderboards offer a valuable way to track and compare the myriad of LLMs available, making them particularly useful for decision-making regarding which models to use.\n\nEach benchmark typically has its own dedicated leaderboard, but independent LLM leaderboards also exist. For example, [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) hosts a collection of leaderboards, including an [open LLM leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/collections/open-llm-leaderboard/the-big-benchmarks-collection-64faca6335a7fc7d4ffe974a) that ranks multiple open-source models based on the ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA\xa0and Winogrande benchmarks.\n\n\u200d\n\n## Common LLM benchmarks\n\n#### Researchers classify LLM\xa0benchmarks based on two main aspects:\n\n1. **Assessment Criteria:** LLM\xa0evaluation metrics can either be based on ground truth or human preferences. Ground truth refers to information assumed to be accurate and factual, while human preferences reflect choices and judgments based on real-world usage.\n2. **Source of Questions:** Prompts used in benchmarks can originate from either static or live sources. Static prompts are predefined questions, while live prompts are generated in interactive environments.\n\nBenchmarks can fall into one or more of these categories. Here's an overview of how some popular benchmarks operate:\n\n**AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC):**\n\nThe ARC benchmark evaluates an LLM’s question-answering and reasoning abilities using over 7,000 grade-school natural science questions. These questions are divided into an easy set and a challenge set. Scoring is straightforward, with models earning one point for each correct answer and 1/N points if multiple answers are provided and one is correct.\n\n[Learn more about ARC](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/arc/submissions/get-started)\n\n**Chatbot Arena:**\n\nChatbot Arena is an open benchmark platform that pits two anonymous chatbots against each other in random real-world conversations. Users then vote on which chatbot they prefer, after which the models’ identities are revealed. This crowdsourced data is used to estimate scores and create approximate rankings for various LLMs, utilizing sampling algorithms to pair models.\n\n[Perform a live Chatbot Arena eval](https://chat.lmsys.org/)\n\n**Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K):**\n\nGSM8K tests an LLM’s mathematical reasoning skills with a corpus of 8,500 grade-school math word problems. Solutions are provided in natural language rather than mathematical expressions, and AI verifiers are trained to evaluate these solutions.\n\n[Learn more about GSM8K](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math?tab=readme-ov-file)\n\n**HellaSwag:**\n\nHellaSwag, an acronym for “Harder Endings, Longer contexts and Low-shot Activities for Situations With Adversarial Generations,” focuses on commonsense reasoning and natural language inference. Models complete sentences by choosing from several possible endings, including wrong answers generated through adversarial filtering. Accuracy is evaluated for both few-shot and zero-shot categories.\n\n[Learn more about HellaSwag](https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/)\n\n**HumanEval:**\n\nHumanEval assesses an LLM’s code generation performance by evaluating functional correctness. Models solve programming problems and are evaluated based on passing the corresponding unit tests. The evaluation metric, pass@k, measures the probability that at least one of the k-generated code solutions passes the unit tests.\n\n[Learn more about HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval)\n\n**Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU):**\n\nMMLU assesses an LLM’s breadth of knowledge, natural language understanding, and problem-solving ability across more than 15,000 multiple-choice general knowledge questions covering 57 subjects. Evaluation is done in few-shot and zero-shot settings, with the final score averaging the model’s accuracy across subjects.\n\n[Learn more about MMLU](https://github.com/hendrycks/test)\n\n**Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP):**\n\nMBPP, or Mostly Basic Python Problems, is a code generation benchmark with over 900 coding tasks. It evaluates functional correctness based on test cases, using metrics like the percentage of problems solved by any sample from the model and the percentage of samples solving their respective tasks.\n\n[Learn more about MBPP](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp)\n\n**MT-Bench:**\n\nCreated by the researchers behind Chatbot Arena, MT-Bench tests an LLM’s dialogue and instruction-following abilities with open-ended multi-turn questions across eight areas: coding, extraction, knowledge I (STEM), knowledge II (humanities and social sciences), math, reasoning, roleplay, and writing. GPT-4 is used to evaluate responses.\n\n[Learn more about MT-Bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge#mt-bench)\n\n**SWE-bench:**\n\nSimilar to HumanEval, SWE-bench evaluates an LLM’s code generation skills, focusing on issue resolution. Models fix bugs or address feature requests in specific code bases, with performance measured by the percentage of resolved task instances.\n\n[Learn more about SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/)\n\n**TruthfulQA:**\n\nAddressing the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate, TruthfulQA measures an LLM’s ability to generate truthful answers. Its dataset includes over 800 questions across 38 subjects, combining human evaluation with the GPT-3 LLM fine-tuned on BLEU and ROUGE metrics to predict informativeness and truthfulness.\n\n[Learn more about TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA)\n\n**Winogrande:**\n\nWinogrande evaluates commonsense reasoning abilities and builds on the original Winograd Schema Challenge. It features a large dataset of 44,000 crowdsourced problems, using adversarial filtering to ensure complexity. Scoring is based on accuracy.\n\n[Learn more about Winogrande](https://winogrande.allenai.org/)\n\n\u200d\n\nIn the rapidly advancing field of AI, LLM benchmarks serve as vital tools for evaluating and refining large language models. They provide essential insights into a model’s strengths and areas for improvement, guiding researchers and developers toward creating more robust and capable AI systems. By offering standardized metrics and frameworks, benchmarks help ensure that LLMs meet high performance and reliability standards, fostering trust and adoption in various applications.\n\nHowever, it’s important to recognize the limitations of current benchmarks. Continuous innovation in benchmarking practices is necessary to keep pace with the evolving capabilities of LLMs. This includes updating benchmarks with more challenging tasks, addressing overfitting issues, and providing more granular performance metrics.\n\nAs the AI landscape continues to grow and diversify, the role of benchmarks will remain crucial. They not only drive the advancement of AI technologies but also support informed decision-making for organizations seeking to integrate AI solutions. By understanding and leveraging the insights provided by LLM benchmarks, we can build more effective, reliable, and ethical AI systems that meet the complex demands of real-world applications.\n\nAt Farpoint, we are committed to advancing the field of AI through rigorous evaluation and benchmarking practices. We invite researchers, developers, and organizations to join us in this mission.

From simple accuracy metrics on narrow tasks to complex evaluations of reasoning and safety, benchmarks have become the driving force behind AI development, helping us understand not just how smart our machines are getting, but also where they still fall short.\n\n## What Are AI Benchmarks?\n\nAt their core, **AI benchmarks** are carefully designed tests that challenge artificial intelligence systems to demonstrate their capabilities under controlled conditions. They typically consist of **datasets** (collections of examples) and **evaluation metrics** (ways to score performance). When an AI model tackles a benchmark, it receives a score that can be compared against other models or against human performance on the same tasks.\n\nAs Stanford HAI explains in their assessment framework, "Benchmarks serve as the primary mechanism for measuring and tracking progress in AI capabilities" ([Stanford HAI, 2024](https://hai.stanford.edu/what-makes-good-ai-benchmark)). They\'re not just academic exercises—benchmarks drive research priorities, influence investment decisions, and increasingly play a role in regulatory frameworks.\n\n### From Leaderboards to Real Progress\n\nThe problem is that without standardized evaluation, comparing AI systems becomes nearly impossible. If Company A tests their chatbot on Shakespeare\'s sonnets while Company B tests theirs on technical manuals, we can\'t meaningfully compare their performance. Benchmarks provide that common ground.\n\nGood benchmarks share several key characteristics:\n\n1. They\'re challenging enough to differentiate between systems\n2. They measure capabilities that actually matter for real-world applications\n3. They\'re resistant to "gaming" or optimization tricks that don\'t reflect genuine improvements\n4. They evolve as AI capabilities advance\n\nWhen a new AI model claims to be "**state-of-the-art**," that claim is almost always backed by benchmark scores. These scores have become the universal language for discussing AI progress—though as we\'ll see later, they come with their own limitations and challenges.\n\n\u200d\n\n## From Simple Tests to Complex Evaluations: The Evolution of AI Benchmarks\n\n### The Early Days: When Accuracy Was King\n\nIn the early days of machine learning, benchmarks were refreshingly straightforward. The **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits, introduced in 1998, asked a simple question: can your algorithm correctly identify these handwritten numbers? Success was measured by **accuracy**—the percentage of digits correctly classified.\n\nThese early benchmarks focused on narrow tasks: image classification, spam detection, or simple natural language processing challenges. They were typically static datasets with clear right and wrong answers, and progress was measured in small percentage improvements in accuracy.\n\n### The Benchmark Explosion: Measuring More Complex Skills\n\nAs AI systems grew more sophisticated through the 2000s and early 2010s, so did the benchmarks used to evaluate them. **ImageNet** raised the bar for computer vision by challenging systems to recognize thousands of object categories. In natural language processing, benchmarks like **GLUE** (General Language Understanding Evaluation) emerged to test understanding across multiple dimensions.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive guide from Evidently AI, "GLUE was among the first comprehensive benchmarks for language understanding tasks, including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and question answering" ([Evidently AI, 2025](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-benchmarks)). These benchmarks weren\'t just harder—they required systems to demonstrate more general capabilities across diverse tasks.\n\n### The LLM Era: Measuring Human-Like Intelligence\n\nThe rise of **large language models** (LLMs) like GPT and their multimodal successors has triggered yet another benchmark revolution. Today\'s leading benchmarks like **MMLU** (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) and **HELM** (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) assess capabilities that would have seemed like science fiction a decade ago: complex reasoning, knowledge application, and even alignment with human values.\n\nModern benchmarks don\'t just ask "Can the AI do this task?" but rather "How human-like is the AI\'s approach?" This shift reflects our changing expectations of AI systems—we\'re no longer satisfied with narrow task performance; we want systems that demonstrate general intelligence across diverse domains.\n\nAs one meta-review of benchmarking practices notes, "Quantitative Artificial Intelligence Benchmarks have emerged as fundamental tools for evaluating the performance, capability, and safety of AI models and systems" ([Eriksson et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06559)). The stakes have never been higher, as these benchmarks now influence everything from research funding to regulatory decisions.\n\n\u200d\n\n## **The Mechanics of Measurement: How AI Benchmarks Function**\n\n### The Dataset: AI\'s Test Questions\n\nAt the heart of every benchmark is a **dataset**—a collection of examples that the AI system must process. These datasets are carefully curated to represent the types of challenges the benchmark aims to measure.\n\nFor language models, these might be thousands of questions spanning topics from physics to literature. For computer vision systems, they could be images with specific labels or attributes. The quality of this dataset is crucial—if it contains biases or doesn\'t adequately represent real-world scenarios, the benchmark results won\'t be meaningful.\n\nCreating these datasets is no small feat. As Datasource Dojo explains, "Benchmark datasets must be diverse enough to test various aspects of model performance while being challenging enough to differentiate between models" ([Datasource Dojo, 2024](https://datasciencedojo.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-for-evaluation/)).\n\n**Dataset Creation Challenges**\n\n**Data diversity** is a critical concern in benchmark creation. Datasets must include examples that cover various scenarios, edge cases, and difficulty levels. They should also represent diverse perspectives and avoid cultural or demographic biases that might skew results.\n\n**Data contamination** is another major challenge. With large language models trained on vast portions of the internet, ensuring that benchmark test data wasn\'t seen during training becomes increasingly difficult.\n\n### The Metrics: Keeping Score\n\nOnce an AI system processes the benchmark dataset, its performance needs to be quantified. This is where **evaluation metrics** come in—mathematical formulas that convert the system\'s responses into numerical scores.\n\nDifferent tasks require different metrics. For classification tasks, accuracy might be sufficient. For more complex tasks like text generation, metrics might include:\n\n* **BLEU** or **ROUGE** scores for measuring text similarity\n* **Perplexity** for assessing language model quality\n* **Human evaluation scores** for subjective assessments\n\nThe best benchmarks use multiple complementary metrics to provide a more complete picture of performance.\n\n### The Submission Process: Ensuring Fair Play\n\nTo maintain integrity, many benchmark leaderboards have specific submission processes. These might include:\n\n* Verification steps to confirm results\n* Requirements to open-source code or models\n* Limits on the number of submissions to prevent "leaderboard hacking"\n\nThese processes help ensure that reported scores reflect genuine capabilities rather than optimization tricks or cherry-picked results.\n\n### The Leaderboard: Tracking Progress\n\nFinally, benchmark results are typically displayed on public **leaderboards** that rank systems by their performance. These leaderboards serve as the public face of benchmarks, driving competition and highlighting progress.\n\nPopular AI Benchmark Frameworks and Their Focus Areas\n\n| Benchmark | Focus Area | Key Metrics | Notable Features |\n| GLUE | Natural Language Understanding | Accuracy, F1 Score | 9 tasks including sentiment analysis, paraphrasing |\n| SuperGLUE | Advanced Language Understanding | Accuracy, F1 Score | More challenging successor to GLUE |\n| MMLU | Multitask Knowledge | Accuracy across domains | 57 subjects from STEM to humanities |\n| BIG-bench | Diverse Capabilities | Task-specific metrics | 204 tasks developed by 442 authors |\n| HELM | Holistic Evaluation | Multiple metrics | Measures across 7 scenarios and 16 metrics |\n\nThe most sophisticated benchmarks don\'t just test performance—they also evaluate other important aspects like **robustness** (performance under challenging conditions), **fairness** (performance across different demographic groups), and **efficiency** (computational resources required).\n\n\u200d\n\n## Benchmark Types: Different Ways to Test AI Smarts\n\n**Language benchmarks** assess how well AI systems understand and generate human language. These have become particularly important with the rise of large language models like GPT and Claude.\n\nThe GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks were early standards that tested basic language understanding through tasks like sentiment analysis and question answering. As models improved, more challenging benchmarks emerged.\n\nMMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) tests knowledge across 57 subjects ranging from mathematics to philosophy. As Confident AI explains, "MMLU evaluates both world knowledge and problem-solving ability in multiple-choice format across diverse academic subjects" ([Confident AI, 2025](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-mmlu-hellaswag-and-beyond)).\n\n**Notable Language Benchmarks**\n\n**HellaSwag** tests common sense reasoning through sentence completion. The benchmark presents models with a situation and asks them to select the most plausible continuation from multiple options.\n\n**TruthfulQA** evaluates a model\'s tendency to generate truthful versus misleading information. This benchmark specifically targets areas where models might have learned common misconceptions or falsehoods.\n\n**BIG-bench** is a collaborative benchmark with 204 diverse tasks, created by hundreds of researchers to test language models across a wide range of capabilities.\n\n### Reasoning and Problem-Solving: Beyond Memorization\n\nPerhaps the most exciting benchmarks test AI\'s ability to reason and solve problems—capabilities that go beyond pattern recognition to approach human-like thinking.\n\nThe **GSM8K** benchmark challenges models with grade-school math word problems, testing their ability to break down problems into steps. Meanwhile, **HumanEval** and **MBPP** assess coding abilities by asking models to generate functioning code based on descriptions.\n\nThese reasoning benchmarks are particularly valuable because they\'re harder to game through memorization. A model that scores well on these tests is demonstrating genuine problem-solving capabilities.\n\n### Multimodal Benchmarks: Beyond Text\n\nAs AI systems expand beyond text to understand images, audio, and video, **multimodal benchmarks** have emerged to test these capabilities.\n\n**MSCOCO** tests image captioning abilities, while **VQA** (Visual Question Answering) challenges models to answer questions about images. More recent benchmarks like **MME** (Multimodal Evaluation) assess how well models can reason across different types of information.\n\n### Safety and Alignment: Testing for Responsible AI\n\nPerhaps the most important emerging category focuses on safety, ethics, and alignment with human values.\n\nThe **COMPL-AI** framework, described by Ivanov and Penchev, "provides the first comprehensive technical interpretation of the EU AI Act in the context of LLMs" by evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements ([Ivanov & Penchev, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01020v1)). Other benchmarks like **ToxiGen** test for harmful outputs, while **RED-EVAL** assesses how well models reject inappropriate requests.\n\nThese safety benchmarks reflect growing awareness that AI systems need to be not just capable, but also responsible and aligned with human values.\n\n\u200d\n\n## Real-World Applications: Benchmarks in Action\n\nFor AI companies, benchmark results aren\'t just bragging rights—they\'re crucial business metrics. When OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google announce a new model, benchmark scores feature prominently in their communications.\n\nThese scores influence everything from funding rounds to customer adoption. As FocalX AI notes, "AI benchmarking is the process of systematically testing and comparing AI models using standardized datasets, metrics, and methodologies" that help companies make strategic decisions ([FocalX AI, 2025](https://focalx.ai/ai/ai-benchmarking/)).\n\nFor enterprise customers selecting AI vendors, benchmarks provide an objective basis for comparison. A company choosing between different AI providers might look at how their models perform on benchmarks relevant to their specific use cases.\n\n**Strategic Benchmark Selection**\n\nSmart companies don\'t just look at the most popular benchmarks—they identify which benchmarks most closely align with their specific use cases. A company focused on customer service automation might prioritize benchmarks that test conversational abilities, while a company developing medical AI might focus on benchmarks testing knowledge and reasoning in healthcare domains.\n\n### Benchmarks in Research and Development\n\nIn research labs around the world, benchmarks drive priorities and measure progress. Researchers design experiments specifically to improve performance on key benchmarks, knowing that significant improvements can lead to publications in top conferences and journals.\n\nThis benchmark-driven approach has accelerated progress in certain areas, but it also shapes which capabilities receive attention. Areas with well-established benchmarks tend to advance more quickly than those without clear metrics for success.\n\n### The Regulatory Dimension\n\nIncreasingly, benchmarks are entering the regulatory conversation. The **EU AI Act**, for instance, requires evaluation of high-risk AI systems against specific criteria—essentially creating regulatory benchmarks.\n\nAs Ivanov and Penchev explain, "The enactment of the EU AI Act by the European Parliament on March 13, 2024, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide requirements for the development, deployment, and use of AI systems, further underscores the importance of tools and methodologies" for evaluation ([Ivanov & Penchev, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01020v1)).\n\n### Benchmarks and Innovation: The Virtuous Cycle\n\nWhen used well, benchmarks create a virtuous cycle of innovation. Clear metrics help researchers identify weaknesses in current approaches and measure improvements from new techniques.\n\nThis dynamic is captured by Datacenter Knowledge\'s observation that "Benchmarks are essentially standardized tests that measure the performance of AI systems on specific tasks and goals, helping identify relevant improvements" that drive the field forward ([Datacenter Knowledge, 2024](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/ai-data-centers/benchmark-to-breakthrough-how-standardized-testing-propels-ai-innovation)).\n\nFor companies like Sandgarden that help enterprises implement AI solutions, benchmarks provide valuable guidance on which models and approaches are most likely to succeed for specific use cases. Rather than starting from scratch with each implementation, teams can leverage benchmark results to make informed choices about which technologies to deploy.\n\n\u200d\n\n## The Not-So-Perfect Measure: Challenges and Limitations\n\nOne of the most persistent challenges with benchmarks is the gap between test performance and real-world utility. Models that achieve impressive benchmark scores sometimes disappoint when deployed in actual applications.\n\nThis happens for several reasons. Benchmark datasets, no matter how carefully constructed, can\'t fully capture the messiness and complexity of real-world scenarios. They often represent simplified versions of the problems AI systems will face in deployment.\n\nAs Eriksson and colleagues point out in their meta-review, benchmarks often suffer from "construct validity issues" where "what is being measured does not align with what we actually care about" ([Eriksson et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06559)). A model might excel at a benchmark by exploiting patterns that don\'t generalize to real-world situations.\n\n### The Distribution Shift Problem\n\n**Distribution shift** occurs when the data a model encounters in the real world differs significantly from the data it was evaluated on. This is a common cause of the performance gap between benchmarks and real-world applications.\n\nFor example, a medical AI system might perform well on a benchmark dataset collected from a specific hospital but struggle when deployed in facilities with different patient demographics or equipment.\n\n### The Optimization Problem: Gaming the System\n\nAnother challenge is that researchers and companies naturally optimize their systems specifically for benchmark performance. This isn\'t cheating per se, but it can lead to systems that are overfit to benchmark tasks rather than developing more general capabilities.\n\nThis phenomenon is sometimes called "**Goodhart\'s Law**" in action: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Models might learn shortcuts or heuristics that work well for benchmark examples but don\'t represent genuine understanding or capability.\n\n### Data Contamination: When the Test Leaks into Training\n\nA particularly thorny issue for modern AI benchmarks is **data contamination**. Large language models are trained on vast swaths of internet text, which may include benchmark examples or discussions of them.\n\nThis creates a situation where models might perform well not because they\'ve learned to solve problems, but because they\'ve memorized specific benchmark examples during training. Researchers work hard to detect and prevent this, but it remains an ongoing challenge.\n\n### The Diversity Problem: Who\'s Not Represented?\n\nMany benchmarks suffer from representation issues. Datasets often reflect the biases and limitations of their creators and the sources they draw from. English-language content dominates many benchmarks, and Western perspectives are overrepresented.\n\nThis lack of diversity means that benchmark results may not generalize across different languages, cultures, or user groups. A model that scores well on standard benchmarks might perform poorly for underrepresented communities.\n\n### Moving Beyond the Numbers\n\nDespite these challenges, benchmarks remain valuable tools—we just need to use them thoughtfully. The most sophisticated approaches now combine quantitative benchmarks with qualitative evaluation, real-world testing, and diverse stakeholder input.\n\nAs Stanford HAI suggests in their framework for evaluating benchmarks themselves, we need to assess benchmarks on criteria including "construct validity, reliability, fairness, robustness, and efficiency" ([Stanford HAI, 2024](https://hai.stanford.edu/what-makes-good-ai-benchmark)). By applying these meta-evaluation criteria, we can develop better benchmarks that more accurately reflect the capabilities we actually care about.\n\n\u200d\n\n## 1The Future of AI Benchmarking\n\nTraditional benchmarks use fixed datasets that remain unchanged over time. This approach has a fundamental weakness: once models master the dataset, the benchmark loses its discriminative power. Worse, models might memorize the specific examples rather than learning general capabilities.\n\nThe future likely belongs to **dynamic benchmarks** that continuously evolve. These might generate new test cases algorithmically or adapt based on model performance. Imagine benchmarks that automatically identify the types of questions a model struggles with and generate more of those challenges.\n\nAs Dev.to\'s guide to AI benchmarks suggests, "Future benchmarks will likely be more dynamic and adaptive, continuously generating new challenges rather than relying on static datasets that can be memorized" ([Dev.to, 2025](https://dev.to/dfordp/definitive-guide-to-ai-benchmarks-comparing-models-testing-your-own-and-understanding-the-future-4d9i)).\n\n**Adversarial benchmarking** represents an emerging approach where benchmarks actively try to find weaknesses in AI systems. Rather than using a fixed set of examples, these benchmarks might employ another AI system to generate increasingly difficult challenges tailored to expose limitations in the system being evaluated.\n\n### Measuring What Matters: Alignment and Safety\n\nAs AI systems become more powerful, evaluating their alignment with human values and safety characteristics becomes increasingly important. Future benchmarks will place greater emphasis on these aspects.\n\nWe\'re already seeing this shift with frameworks like COMPL-AI that evaluate compliance with regulatory requirements. Future benchmarks might assess:\n\n* How well models avoid harmful outputs across diverse contexts\n* Whether systems can appropriately decline inappropriate requests\n* How models handle ambiguous instructions where human values should guide responses\n* The system\'s ability to acknowledge uncertainty rather than confidently providing incorrect information\n\n### Benchmarks for Emerging Capabilities\n\nAs AI systems develop new capabilities, benchmarks will emerge to measure them. Areas likely to see new benchmark development include:\n\n* **Agentic behavior**: Evaluating how well AI systems can plan and execute multi-step tasks\n* **Tool use**: Measuring how effectively AI can leverage external tools and APIs\n* **Multimodal reasoning**: Assessing understanding across text, images, audio, and video\n* **Long-context understanding**: Testing comprehension and reasoning over very long inputs\n* **Interactive evaluation**: Measuring performance in dynamic, multi-turn interactions\n\n### Collaborative Benchmark Development\n\nThe future of benchmarking will likely be more collaborative and inclusive. Projects like **BIG-bench** have already demonstrated the value of bringing together diverse contributors to design evaluation tasks.\n\nThis collaborative approach helps address some of the diversity and representation issues in current benchmarks. By including perspectives from different disciplines, cultures, and backgrounds, we can create more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.\n\n### Integration with Real-World Testing\n\nPerhaps the most important trend will be tighter integration between benchmark evaluation and real-world testing. Rather than treating benchmarks as separate from deployment, future approaches will likely combine controlled benchmark testing with real-world performance monitoring.\n\nPlatforms like Sandgarden that help companies implement AI solutions are well-positioned to contribute to this integration. By tracking how models perform in actual business applications, these platforms can provide valuable feedback to benchmark designers about which metrics actually predict real-world success.\n\n\u200d\n\n## Wrapping Up: Why Benchmarks Matter for AI Progress\n\nBenchmarks provide the shared language that allows the AI community to measure progress. Without them, claims about AI capabilities would be subjective and difficult to verify. Benchmarks transform vague assertions like "our model is really good at understanding language" into specific, measurable results that can be compared and built upon.\n\nThis quantification of progress has accelerated AI development dramatically. When researchers can clearly see which approaches work best on standardized tasks, they can build on those successes rather than reinventing the wheel. The rapid advances in AI capabilities over the past decade owe much to this benchmark-driven development cycle.\n\nAt the same time, we\'ve seen that benchmarks have significant limitations. They can create perverse incentives, fail to capture real-world complexity, and suffer from various biases and blind spots. As AI systems become more powerful and integrated into society, these limitations become increasingly consequential.\n\nThe future of AI benchmarking will require balancing competing priorities: maintaining comparability while preventing gaming; measuring specific capabilities while capturing general intelligence; evaluating performance while assessing safety and alignment. This won\'t be easy, but it\'s essential work if AI is to develop in beneficial directions.\n\nFor organizations implementing AI solutions, benchmarks provide crucial guidance. They help identify which models and approaches are most likely to succeed for specific use cases. Platforms like Sandgarden that streamline AI implementation allow teams to focus on solving business problems rather than getting bogged down in technical details.\n\nUltimately, benchmarks are tools—powerful ones, but still just tools.

But what exactly are these benchmarks, and how can we use them wisely? This ultimate guide will demystify AI benchmarks – explaining what they are and why they matter, surveying key benchmark categories (from language and vision to multimodal and beyond), and providing pragmatic advice on interpreting results and using benchmarks in real-world decisions. We’ll also see how today’s top AI models (think GPT-4o, Claude 3, Google’s Gemini, and more) stack up on these tests as of mid-2025. By the end, you’ll understand the landscape of AI benchmarks and how to navigate it without falling into common pitfalls. Let’s set sail!\n\nWhat Are AI Benchmarks and Why Do They Matter?\n\nAI benchmarks are standardized tests or evaluation suites used to measure and compare the performance of AI models on specific tasks. In essence, a benchmark provides a common dataset and metric so researchers and developers can answer: “How well does Model A perform at Task X versus Model B?”\n\nKey reasons benchmarks matter:\n\n**Tracking Progress**: Benchmarks act as mileposts for progress in AI. When a new model achieves a higher score on a respected benchmark, it’s evidence of advancement in that capability.\n\n**Fair Comparison**: By evaluating models on the same tasks with the same metrics, benchmarks allow apples-to-apples comparisons. This helps identify state-of-the-art techniques and encourages competition.\n\n**Reliability Check**: Consistent benchmark results give confidence that a model’s performance isn’t a fluke. Benchmarks often include diverse or tricky test cases to reveal if a model is robust or if it has glaring weaknesses (e.g. poor generalization or bias)\n\n**Goal Setting**: Benchmarks often represent challenging real-world tasks, so they serve as target objectives for the field (e.g. “reach human-level performance on XYZ benchmark”). They focus research effort on important problems.\n\n**Accountability and Transparency**: Especially for applied AI, benchmark scores provide an evidence-based way to report how good a model is. This transparency is useful for stakeholders, customers, or regulators who want proof of performance\n\nAI benchmarks are to AI models what standardized exams are to students – an imperfect but useful measure of capability. A good benchmark is carefully designed to test meaningful skills, be difficult to “game,” and have broad relevance.\n\nNot all benchmarks are created equal (as we’ll discuss later), but collectively they have driven AI innovation by providing clear yardsticks for success. Next, we’ll explore the major categories of benchmarks and some prominent examples in each.\n\n*Looking to benchmark your AI projects with confidence? Consider the* [*AI Essentials by Google*](https://imp.i384100.net/zxOOy7) *course\\* — it’s designed to help you understand, choose, and apply the most effective evaluation techniques for real-world AI models.*\n\nAI is a broad field, so there are many benchmarks tailored to different domains and tasks. Below, we break down key benchmark areas:\n\n**Language Understanding** (how well models comprehend and analyze text),\n\n**Language Generation** (how well models produce text or code),\n\n**Computer Vision** (image and video understanding),\n\n**Multimodal** (combining text, vision, etc.),\n\n**Reinforcement Learning** (decision-making in interactive environments),\n\n**Efficiency & Scaling** (performance and resource use), and\n\n**Robustness & Fairness** (emerging tests for reliability and ethics).\n\nFor each area, we’ll highlight representative benchmarks, what they measure, and notable models or results.\n\n**Language understanding** benchmarks evaluate a model’s ability to read or interpret text and grasp meaning, perform reasoning, or answer questions. These benchmarks typically involve tasks like question answering, classification, inference, and common sense reasoning. They were crucial in the development of NLP systems and remain important today.\n\n* **GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)**: GLUE was introduced in 2018 as a collection of 9 diverse NLP tasks (such as sentiment analysis, linguistic acceptability, question answering, and textual entailment). Models get an aggregate score across all tasks. GLUE’s goal was to encourage general-purpose language understanding systems. Early transformer models like BERT and GPT made rapid progress on GLUE; in fact, GLUE became “easy” for top models by 2019-2020 (many models scored above humans on the GLUE score). This led to the creation of SuperGLUE.\n* **SuperGLUE**: SuperGLUE is a tougher successor to GLUE with 8 more difficult language tasks (including ones like BoolQ, RTE, Winograd schemas for common sense, and others). The human baseline on SuperGLUE was about 89.8 (estimated average human performance). Within just a couple of years, frontier models surpassed this human level – for example, Google’s PaLM (540B) scored ~90.4 and OpenAI’s GPT-4 slightly above that, essentially “solving” SuperGLUE by 2023. In fact, by mid-2023 several in the SuperGLUE leaderboard were above human level. This saturation showed how far NLP had come, but also meant researchers needed even harder benchmarks to stress-test the newest models.\n* [**MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**](https://www.theainavigator.com/blog/what-is-mmlu-massive-multitask-language-understanding): MMLU is an advanced benchmark introduced in 2021 to evaluate broad knowledge and reasoning. It consists of 57 subjects of multiple-choice questions, ranging from elementary math and geography to graduate-level biology and law. The questions require not just rote knowledge but reasoning across many domains, simulating a comprehensive exam for AI. Models are evaluated on accuracy (percent of questions answered correctly) overall and per subject. Initially, most models performed only slightly above random chance on MMLU. But large language models changed the game: GPT-3 boosted scores significantly, and by 2023 GPT-4 achieved 86.4% accuracy on MMLU – approaching the ~89-90% level of human subject-matter experts. This was a dramatic leap from GPT-3’s ~40% just a few years prior. Other top models in 2025 include Google’s Gemini Ultra (~83.7%) and Anthropic’s Claude 2 (~81.8%) on MMLU. MMLU is now a key reference point for general knowledge capability. (Notably, its creators also identified flaws – e.g. errors in certain subsets – reminding us no benchmark is perfect.)\n* **Other NLP Understanding Benchmarks**: The above are general-purpose benchmarks, but many others target specific aspects of language understanding:\n\n+ **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: A reading comprehension test where models answer questions by extracting answers from passages. SQuAD was an early benchmark where models eventually surpassed human extractive QA performance.\n+ **HellaSwag**: A commonsense reasoning benchmark requiring picking the best continuation of a story or scene description. It tests a model’s grasp of context and likely outcomes – large LMs like GPT-3+ perform very well, highlighting their grasp of commonsense patterns.\n+ **Winograd-style tasks (e.g. WSC, Winogrande)**: These test pronoun resolution in ambiguous sentences using commonsense (e.g. “The trophy doesn’t fit in the suitcase because it is too large.” What is too large?). Such problems are easy for humans but tricky for AI without true understanding. Large models have improved here, especially with specialized training.\n+ **BIG-bench and BBH (Big-Bench Hard)**: A collection of challenging tasks created by dozens of researchers to test the limits of LLMs. BBH is a subset of especially difficult tasks that earlier models struggled with.\n\n**What to watch**: *Language understanding benchmarks have had to evolve rapidly* because models caught up with many of them. The trend now is toward more **comprehensive or dynamic evaluations** that go beyond static test sets – for example, the BIG-bench tasks, or adversarially constructed tests that evolve over time. Nonetheless, GLUE/SuperGLUE and MMLU remain staples to report if you want to show your model handles general NLP tasks. If a new model can’t at least approach human-level on these, it’s likely behind the curve in core language understanding.\n\nLanguage Generation Benchmarks (NLP Generation & Coding)\n\nIf language understanding tests how well a model *interprets* text, **language generation** benchmarks test how well it can *produce* text. This includes translating languages, writing summaries, answering open-ended questions, or even writing code. Generation quality is harder to measure with a single “right answer,” so benchmarks use metrics that compare model outputs to references or evaluate functional correctness.\n\nKey benchmark examples:\n\n* **Machine Translation (WMT)**: Every year, the WMT competition provides test sets for translation between many language pairs. Performance is usually measured in **BLEU score** – a metric of how closely a model’s translations match human reference translations (higher is better). Top models (often using transformer architectures) now reach very high BLEU scores, even surpassing human translators on some language pairs. However, translation benchmarks also emphasize multilingual breadth (how a model handles many languages) and robustness (handling colloquialisms, etc.). By 2025, models like **Google’s translation systems or Meta’s NLLB** can translate 100+ languages with strong accuracy, and large LLMs like GPT-4 can perform translation reasonably well via few-shot prompting (though specialized models still lead in pure BLEU).\n* **Text Summarization (CNN/DailyMail, XSum, etc.)**: Summarization benchmarks have documents or articles and ask the model to produce a condensed summary. Metrics like **ROUGE** (which counts overlapping n-grams between the summary and a reference summary) are used to score performance. High ROUGE scores indicate the model captured important points, though they don’t guarantee the summary is truly coherent. Models like **PEGASUS** and GPT-based systems fine-tuned on news data achieved strong results on CNN/DailyMail and XSum by 2021, and today’s largest models continue to improve summary coherence. However, evaluating generation remains tricky – sometimes a model can get a decent ROUGE score but produce factual errors or awkward phrasing not penalized by the metric. This is why human evaluation is still often used as a supplement for generation tasks.\n* **Open-Ended Q&A and Creative Generation**: Benchmarks like **TruthfulQA** test whether a model’s generated answers to open questions are accurate and free of misinformation. There are also story generation or dialogue benchmarks (e.g. the **DSTC** challenge for dialogue systems). These rely on either human ratings or specialized metrics (like BLEU, METEOR, or newer learned metrics) to evaluate quality. As of 2025, GPT-4 and Claude are known for strong open-ended generation – they can produce long-form answers or stories that often receive high ratings for fluency. Creative tasks are harder to “benchmark” objectively, but competitions (like writing a short story with specific elements) have been proposed.\n* **Code Generation (**[**HumanEval**](https://www.theainavigator.com/blog/what-do-we-mean-by-humaneval) **and beyond)**: A notable type of language generation is **code synthesis**. OpenAI’s HumanEval is a benchmark where models generate Python code to solve 164 programming problems, assessed by running tests to see if the code is functionally correct. The metric here is usually pass@k, e.g. pass@1 means the model’s first attempt solves the problem. This tests a model’s logical and coding ability. GPT-4 excels here – it reportedly achieves above 85%+ on HumanEval (pass@1), a massive jump from earlier code models. (OpenAI’s published technical report put GPT-4’s zero-shot pass@1 at 67 %, and independent groups coaxed the model above 85 % with chain-of-thought plus sampling tricks.) Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude 3 are also proficient in code: one comparison showed Gemini scoring ~74.4% vs GPT-4’s 73.9% on Python coding tasks, meaning they are roughly on par for generating working code. There are expanded code benchmarks too (like the MBPP and BigCode evals with hundreds of problems, or multi-language coding tests) – all indicating that modern models can generate correct code for many standard problems. However, they can still struggle with very complex, multi-step coding tasks or when dealing with unfamiliar APIs.\n\nTo sum it up, language generation benchmarks tell us how expressive, coherent, and correct a model’s outputs are. Metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and accuracy on test cases give quantitative signals, but interpreting them requires care – e.g. a slightly lower BLEU might not be noticeable to a human, whereas factual accuracy (not captured by BLEU) is crucial in practice. We’ll discuss metrics interpretation more later.\n\n*Whether you’re refining AI models or preparing for real-world deployment, learning Python is crucial. The* [*Python for Data Science, AI & Development*](https://imp.i384100.net/Oe9dJQ)*\\* course will equip you with the practical skills needed to manipulate data and support AI benchmarking workflows.*\n\nComputer Vision Benchmarks\n\nAs you can imagine, computer vision benchmarks evaluate a model’s ability to understand images or videos. They often involve classification (what is in this image?), localization (where are the objects?), or description (what’s happening in this scene?). Vision benchmarks drove much progress in the 2010s and continue to be relevant, though some are now saturated by near-perfect scores.\n\n* **ImageNet**: The *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge* was the landmark vision benchmark of the 2010s. It involves classifying images into 1000 object categories. Back in 2012, a breakthrough came when a deep learning model (AlexNet) dramatically beat older methods, and by 2015-2016 models like ResNet surpassed human-level accuracy (~95% top-5 accuracy) on ImageNet. (See also the [AI Timeline: a Journey Through The History of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.theainavigator.com/ai-timeline).) Today, state-of-the-art models (e.g. Vision Transformers or large foundation models) exceed 90%+ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, essentially near saturation. ImageNet forced models to handle diverse images “in the wild” and remains a benchmark reported in research, but differences at the top are now just fractions of a percent. Nonetheless, if a model can’t perform well on ImageNet, it’s not considered competitive for general vision tasks.\n* **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: MS COCO is a dataset for object **detection** (identifying and localizing multiple objects in an image) and **segmentation** (precisely outlining objects). COCO’s detection benchmark uses **mean Average Precision (mAP)** – a metric that combines precision/recall for predicted bounding boxes of objects. Top models (often using architectures like Faster R-CNN, YOLO, or Transformer-based DETR variants) continually push mAP higher. As of 2025, mAP on COCO (for detection) is above 60% for the best models (which is very high given the challenge), whereas early models in 2015 were below 30%. COCO also has an *image captioning* challenge (describing the image in a sentence), which overlaps with multimodal benchmarks.\n* **Semantic Segmentation (e.g. Cityscapes)**: Vision benchmarks also include pixel-level tasks like labeling each pixel of an image (important for e.g. self-driving car vision). Cityscapes benchmark evaluates segmentation in urban street scenes. Metrics here include **IoU (Intersection over Union)** for how well predicted segments overlap ground truth. Models have exceeded human-level segmentation quality in some of these controlled benchmarks, though real-world robustness can still falter.\n* **Face Recognition and Specialty Benchmarks**: There are specific benchmarks for face recognition (e.g. LFW – Labeled Faces in the Wild) where top AI systems have 99%+ accuracy, or for medical imaging (e.g. classifying X-rays in the CheXpert benchmark). In many niche areas, AI matches or surpasses average human performance on the benchmark, but careful testing is needed to ensure this holds in deployment (for instance, an X-ray model might do great on CheXpert but fail on a different hospital’s data due to subtle differences).\n\n**Trends in vision**: Many vision benchmarks are now complemented by *robustness tests*. For example, models that ace ImageNet can still be fooled by slight image corruptions or adversarial noise. This led to benchmarks like **ImageNet-C (corrupted)** and **ImageNet-A (adversarial)** to measure robustness. A truly strong vision model is one that not only scores high on the standard test but maintains performance under less ideal conditions. By mid-2020s, researchers report diminishing returns on static benchmarks – new models often perform similarly on ImageNet, so they are differentiated more by robustness or efficiency. That’s why **MLPerf** (below) and other efficiency benchmarks have become important for vision too.\n\nMultimodal Benchmarks (Vision+Language and Beyond)\n\nMultimodal benchmarks test AI models that handle multiple types of data together – typically vision & language, but also audio, video, etc. With the rise of models like GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini (which are inherently multimodal), these benchmarks assess integrated understanding.\n\n* **VQA (Visual Question Answering)**: In VQA, models are given an image and a natural language question about the image, and must output a text answer. For example, an image of people on a beach with the question “What sport are they playing?” → answer “Beach volleyball.” The VQAv2 benchmark is well-known; it requires both image recognition and language comprehension to get correct answers. Accuracy (percentage of questions answered correctly as judged by humans) is the typical metric. Early VQA models (circa 2016) had lots of trouble, often just guessing common answers. By 2023-2024, large multimodal models like GPT-4V or specialized models (e.g. Vision-Transformer + LLM hybrids) achieved much higher VQA accuracy, often 80%+. This means these top models can interpret images nearly as well as text prompts in many cases.\n\n* **Image Captioning**: Here, the model generates a descriptive caption for an image (e.g. “A dog catching a frisbee in a park.”). COCO Captions is a standard benchmark. Metrics include BLEU (comparing to reference captions) and CIDEr (which gives higher weight to important words). Current vision-language models can produce very human-like captions, with top CIDEr scores in the 130-140 range (human reference captions score around 85-90 by definition of the metric). So AI can actually *outscore humans* in matching the consensus description, though that doesn’t always mean the captions are better – just more consistent with typical wording.\n* **Visual Grounding and Reference**: Tasks like pointing out a described object in an image (“Click on the man wearing a hat”) combine language and vision understanding. Benchmarks like RefCOCO measure this. These have improved with multimodal transformers and CLIP-like models aligning vision and text features.\n* **Video+Language**: Newer multimodal benchmarks go 3D: eg. VATEX or MSR-VTT for video captioning (describing a short video clip) and AudioVisual tasks (like answering questions about a video with sound). These are extremely challenging because they require temporal understanding. Gemini is reported to handle video+audio input, so benchmarks here are evolving. As of 2025, human parity is not yet reached in complex video QA tasks – models might catch certain events but miss nuances. Metrics are often variants of BLEU/CIDEr or human evals due to complexity.\n\nOverall, multimodal benchmarks are *rapidly developing*. With foundation models that ingest images, audio, etc., expect new benchmarks that evaluate holistic understanding (e.g. an AI reading a document and looking at an attached diagram to answer questions). In fact, OpenAI and others have started releasing combined tasks (like DocVQA for answering from document images, or science diagrams QA). These benchmarks often reveal differences between models: for instance, GPT-4’s vision extension (GPT-4V) was very strong at analysis tasks, but Gemini was shown to be especially good at creative cross-modal generation (like drawing information from text and generating an image description).\n\nReinforcement Learning Benchmarks\n\n[Reinforcement Learning](https://www.theainavigator.com/blog/what-is-reinforcement-learning-rl) (RL) benchmarks test an AI agent’s ability to make decisions in an environment to maximize reward, rather than just predicting outputs from a fixed dataset. These tasks are often games or simulations. RL benchmarks differ in that performance is measured by a reward score or win rate, and training efficiency can also be considered.\n\n* **Atari Games (Arcade Learning Environment)**: A classic RL benchmark suite: dozens of Atari 2600 video games (like Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders - remember these?). The agent sees the game screen pixels and outputs joystick actions, aiming to maximize game score. Researchers often report performance as a percentage of human baseline score on each game. DeepMind’s DQN (2015) was a breakthrough that could play many games at superhuman levels. Since then, even more powerful algorithms (Rainbow DQN, MuZero, etc.) pushed scores further. By 2020, AI could beat human records on the majority of Atari games, some by large margins. However, some games with sparse rewards remain challenging. The Atari suite taught the community about generalization in RL (some agents would [overfit](https://www.theainavigator.com/blog/what-is-over-fitting-in-ai-and-why-is-it-a-problem) to specific games). It’s still a go-to benchmark for new RL algorithms due to its variety and historical comparisons.\n* **Continuous Control (MuJoCo, Robotics)**: Benchmarks like OpenAI Gym’s MuJoCo tasks (e.g. making a simulated humanoid walk, or a half-cheetah run) measure control in continuous action spaces. The metric is the cumulative reward (distance traveled, etc.). Many RL algorithms can now train policies that achieve near-optimal scores on these tasks. Policy gradient methods and evolution strategies also compete here. Beyond MuJoCo, there are robotic manipulation benchmarks (like solving a Rubik’s cube or controlling robot arms). These tasks highlight sample efficiency and stability of learning.\n* **Strategic Games**: DeepMind’s **AlphaGo** and AlphaZero demonstrated superhuman Go and Chess, but those aren’t everyday benchmarks (since they require huge compute). However, simpler strategy games or puzzles are used as benchmarks: e.g. **GridWorld** planning tasks, or **NetHack (a rogue-like game)** which tests long-horizon planning in a dungeon crawl. OpenAI’s **Gym Retro** also allowed playing old console games to test generalization. Performance is typically measured by game score or level reached.\n* **Multi-Agent and Complex Simulators**: Modern RL benchmarks also include things like **hide-and-seek** emergent skill environments, StarCraft II (DeepMind’s AlphaStar achieved Grandmaster level in 2019), and **Dota 2** (OpenAI Five team beat champions in 2018). These are remarkable milestones, but they are one-off achievements more than standardized benchmarks others can easily run (due to huge compute needs). That said, scaled-down versions (like a StarCraft mini-games benchmark or Minecraft navigation tasks) exist for research.\n\n**A practical note**: Many pure RL benchmarks are somewhat separated from the large language model world – they often require training agents from scratch in simulation. However, we are seeing convergence with “**embodied AI**” benchmarks where an LLM might control an agent (for example, an AI agent in Minecraft following instructions, measured by tasks completed). Benchmarks like **MineRL** (Minecraft challenges) and the **Meta-World** (multi-task robotics) are gaining traction. In 2025, hybrid models that use LLMs for high-level planning and RL for low-level control are being evaluated on these integrated benchmarks.\n\nEfficiency and Scaling Benchmarks\n\nSo far, the benchmarks we discussed measure *accuracy or capability*. But in the real world, **speed, efficiency, and scalability** are also critical. Two key aspects are: *How fast can a model run*? and *How well does performance scale with more compute or data*? Benchmarks in this category are a bit different – often focusing on hardware or algorithm efficiency rather than just raw accuracy.\n\n* **MLPerf**: MLPerf is an industry-standard benchmark suite (from the MLCommons consortium) that evaluates how quickly hardware systems can train or run AI models. There are MLPerf Training benchmarks (e.g. how fast can you train ResNet-50 on ImageNet to 75% accuracy) and MLPerf Inference benchmarks (e.g. how many images per second can you classify with ResNet or how many BERT questions can you answer per second) on various platforms (datacenter, edge devices). MLPerf essentially turns AI into a speed race under fixed conditions – companies like NVIDIA, Google, etc., submit their hardware+software stacks to see who’s the fastest. It provides valuable **technical info for customers** about performance and energy efficiency. For example, if you’re choosing an AI chip for your data center, MLPerf scores can inform you which option will give more throughput or lower latency for your workload. MLPerf doesn’t tell you which model is more accurate (the models are usually fixed reference implementations), but rather how different systems fare running those models. By 2025, MLPerf results show impressive numbers – e.g., a training run of ResNet-50 that took days on a single GPU in 2015 can now finish in under a minute on a latest AI supercomputer cluster! Inference benchmarks similarly show some networks processing tens of thousands of images or queries per second on specialized hardware. For AI practitioners, MLPerf is a go-to for benchmarking **efficiency**.\n* **Scaling Law Benchmarks**: Another angle is how performance scales with model size or data. OpenAI’s work with **Scaling Laws** (and follow-ups like DeepMind’s **Chinchilla** study) found predictable relationships: generally, bigger models perform better (on benchmarks) but with diminishing returns, and training data also boosts performance. While not a benchmark suite per se, researchers often report how a model’s score on benchmarks like GLUE or MMLU changes as the model size goes from, say, 1B to 10B to 100B parameters. These scaling experiments are benchmarks in their own right, revealing at what point more parameters yield minor gains. They also highlight efficiency trade-offs: a model twice as large might get a slightly higher accuracy on a benchmark but will use more than twice the compute (both for training and inference). As Alex de Vries notes, “bigger is better” for performance, but also far less efficient – and despite interest in efficiency, the competitive pressure is to keep adding parameters and data to push benchmark scores up. This dynamic is clear in 2025’s landscape: GPT-4.5 is larger and performs better on many benchmarks than its smaller predecessors, but at a huge compute cost.\n* **Energy and Sustainability Benchmarks**: Given the concerns above, initiatives have started to benchmark models by **energy usage**. One example is the **AI Energy Score** (a collaboration by Salesforce, Hugging Face, etc.) announced in early 2025. It aims to rate models similar to appliance energy labels, measuring things like power (GPU hours) needed for inference or training. There’s even an [AI Energy Score leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AIEnergyScore/Leaderboard) emerging. While these are new, they signal that beyond accuracy, the community is starting to value models that achieve more with less. Another related metric is **latency** or response time – especially for real-time applications. A model might have super high accuracy on a benchmark but if it takes 30 seconds to respond, it’s not practical for, say, an AI assistant. Thus, papers increasingly report not just benchmark accuracy but also inference speed or cost for context.\n\nEfficiency/scaling benchmarks remind us that **the “best” model isn’t only about highest accuracy** – it’s about the best trade-off between accuracy and resources. We’ll revisit this trade-off when discussing practical decisions.\n\nRobustness and Fairness Benchmarks (Emerging Areas)\n\nFinally, as AI systems become widely deployed, **robustness** (reliability under varied conditions) and **fairness** (unbiased, equitable performance across different groups) have become crucial. New benchmarks are emerging to put numbers behind these aspects:\n\n* **Robustness Benchmarks**: These tests often take an existing task and introduce *perturbations*. For example, **ImageNet-C** adds common corruptions (blur, noise, weather effects) to images to see if classification accuracy drops. **ImageNet-A** contains naturally occurring adversarial images that fool models even though humans classify them correctly. There are also **Adversarial QA** datasets in NLP where questions are designed to trick models or exploit their blind spots. Another example is **WILDS (Workshop on Out-Of-Distribution Learning)** – a benchmark collection where the test data is from a different distribution than training data (e.g. classifying poverty in satellite images across countries, where a model must generalize beyond the region it was trained on). Top models still often struggle on these robustness tests: a model with 90% on normal data might drop to 50% on a slightly shifted distribution. Researchers use these benchmarks to iterate on more robust training methods (like data augmentation, adversarial training, etc.) and measure progress.\n* **Fairness and Bias Benchmarks**: Measuring fairness involves checking model performance across demographics or detecting biased outputs. In computer vision, a notable new benchmark is **FACET (Fairness in CV Evaluation)** released by Meta in 2023. FACET contains images with labels across attributes like gender, skin tone, age, etc., allowing evaluation of whether an object detector works equally well for people of different skin tones. In NLP, there are datasets like **StereoSet** or **CrowS-Pairs** which test if a language model exhibits stereotypes (by completing sentences with biased implications). Another is **BBQ (Bias Benchmark for QA)** which checks if a QA system’s answers differ based on sensitive attributes in the question. Metrics here might be the difference in accuracy between groups, or more direct measures of bias (like a “bias score” where lower is better). There’s also work on **toxicity benchmarks** – e.g. testing how often a model produces hate speech or toxic content given neutral prompts.\n* **Robustness to Adversaries**: Beyond data shifts, some benchmarks pit AIs against clever adversaries or tricky logic puzzles. For instance, **ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)** is a set of visual puzzles that require abstract pattern recognition; it was proposed as a test of general intelligence and remains extremely hard (random performance for most models). And recently, the concept of a “**HARD**” benchmark or even an **“AGI last exam”** has been floated – e.g. **Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE)** with ultra-hard questions where current models score <10%. These aren’t mainstream yet, but they illustrate efforts to push the limits.\n\nWe recognize that leaderboards can be misleading if models exploit shortcuts, and this is why robustness and fairness benchmarks are becoming part of the evaluation toolkit for serious AI releases. Most leading model developers now report performance on some robust QA and bias tests to demonstrate safety characteristics. As of 2025, expect any top-tier model to come with an evaluation not only on accuracy benchmarks, but also on how it handles ethical and robustness challenges.\n\n...\n\nNow that we've surveyed benchmark categories and examples, let's talk about **benchmark metrics** - understadning the scores and what they mean - and then how to **interpret and use** these benchmarks in practice.\n\nUnderstanding Benchmark Metrics and Trade-Offs\n\nEach benchmark comes with its own metric (or set of metrics) to quantify performance. Here we break down some common metrics and how to interpret them, as well as the trade-offs and caveats to keep in mind.\n\n* **Accuracy**: This is perhaps the simplest metric – the percentage of predictions the model got correct. It’s used in classification tasks (e.g. ImageNet, where accuracy = percent of images correctly classified) and many QA tasks (percent of questions answered exactly right). **Higher accuracy is better**, and 100% means perfect performance on the test set. When reading accuracy, consider the baseline: Is 50% accuracy random guessing or much better than random? For example, on a 4-option multiple choice (like MMLU), random is 25%. So a model getting 50% is actually quite strong (2x random), while 50% in a binary classification might be just chance. Accuracy is easy to understand, but it doesn’t tell you *how or why* mistakes happen.\n* **Precision, Recall, F1**: These metrics come up especially in tasks with class imbalance or where false alarms vs. misses matter (like detection or information retrieval):\n\n+ **Precision** = Of the items the model labeled as X, what fraction were *actually* X? (High precision means few false positives.)\n+ **Recall** = Of the items that were actually X, what fraction did the model *correctly find*? (High recall means few false negatives.)\n+ **F1 score** = The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single score that balances both (useful when you want a combined measure). F1 is often reported in NLP tasks like classification or entity extraction, where both false alarms and misses are important. An F1 of 100% is perfect; an F1 that’s significantly lower than accuracy indicates an imbalance or more nuanced performance issue.\n\n* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: A common metric for machine translation (and sometimes used for text generation). BLEU compares the overlap of n-grams (phrases of length 1,2,3,4) between the model’s output and reference human translations. It’s basically a precision measure on text, penalizing if the model’s wording is very different from any reference. BLEU ranges from 0 to 100 (though in practice even humans don’t get 100 since there are many valid translations). How do we interpret BLEU? Roughly, above 30 can indicate understandable translations, 40-50 is often professional quality, and over 50 is exceedingly high (often possible when multiple references or very predictable text). However, BLEU has known limitations – it may not reward fluency or logical correctness, just n-gram overlap. So a high BLEU is necessary but not sufficient for a “good” translation.\n* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: Used for summarization, it checks how many overlapping n-grams the summary has with a reference summary (more recall-focused). If a model’s summary hits all the key words/phrases a human summary has, ROUGE will be high. As with BLEU, ROUGE doesn’t capture coherence, just content overlap.\n* **Exact Match and EM/F1**: In QA benchmarks like SQuAD, **Exact Match (EM)** measures whether the answer string matches the ground truth exactly (e.g. the model answered “Abraham Lincoln” and the reference was “Abraham Lincoln”). The F1 in such cases treats the answer as a bag of words and checks overlap – helpful when there are multiple correct ways to phrase an answer. High EM is very strict; F1 gives partial credit for getting some of the answer right.\n* **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: Common in object detection (like COCO). Without getting into detail, AP is calculated for each class as the area under the precision-recall curve, and mAP is the mean across classes. **Higher mAP means better detection quality**. A jump of even 1-2 points mAP is considered significant in detection research.\n* **Mean IoU**: Used in segmentation, it measures overlap of predicted vs true mask for each class, averaged. If Mean IoU = 0.65 (65%), that means on average the model overlaps 65% with the true region for each class – a decent score depending on task difficulty.\n* **Human-parity metrics**: Sometimes you’ll see results like “our model reached human-level on X”. This usually means the model’s score equaled or exceeded an estimated human performance on that test. For example, human performance on SuperGLUE was ~89.8, so when a model hit ~90, it was declared to surpass humans. It’s important to ask how was human performance measured. Often it’s non-expert humans on Mechanical Turk doing the test. Expert humans could do better. So “human parity” on a benchmark doesn’t always equate to superhuman in general – it’s just a milestone on that narrow test.\n\n**Interpreting Scores Thoughtfully**: Always consider context. *A single number can hide a lot*. For example, a model might have high average accuracy but might consistently fail on a certain subset of the data (like always getting questions about chemistry wrong). If possible, look at per-category scores or error analysis. Many benchmarks provide breakdowns (e.g. MMLU gives accuracy per subject – a model might be great at humanities but weaker at math). So use those to understand strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAlso, differences can be within margin of error. Particularly for large models evaluated on relatively small test sets, an extra 1-2 correct answers could change the score by a point. So when Model A scores 85.0 and Model B 84.5, it’s essentially a tie – not a meaningful edge.\n\n**Trade-offs and Caveats**:\n\n* A model that tops a benchmark may do so by **exploiting quirks** of that benchmark (a phenomenon known as **overfitting to the benchmark** or “gaming” it). Some question-answer models were found to pick up on annotation artifacts rather than truly understanding the question. When tested slightly differently, they failed. Researchers call this “benchmark saturation” – where models hit high scores without necessarily achieving the underlying capability the benchmark intended to measure. Always be wary of whether a benchmark still has headroom or if models are approaching an implicit ceiling (sometimes due to label noise, etc.).\n* There’s often a **trade-off between capability and efficiency**: bigger models with more training data tend to score higher on benchmarks, but they are slower and more expensive. Depending on your needs, a slightly lower score might be acceptable for a huge gain in speed or cost savings. Benchmarks themselves rarely incorporate cost, so it’s on you to weigh that.\n* The **law of diminishing returns** applies. You might need a model 10x larger to gain 2 extra points on a benchmark. Are those 2 points worth it? Sometimes yes (if it’s the difference between occasional failure vs reliable success on a critical task), but often not for practical applications.\n* Some metrics can be misleading if taken blindly. For example, high BLEU in translation doesn’t guarantee factual accuracy in the translation (it might just be literal). High accuracy on a biased dataset doesn’t mean the model is fair. The old saying “**What gets measured gets managed**” holds. Models will optimize for the metric, which might not capture everything we care about. This is why a holistic evaluation (considering multiple benchmarks and qualitative tests) is recommended for serious deployments.\n\nBenchmark metrics are invaluable tools – they give us objective numbers to track progress. But always interpret them with a dose of critical thinking and domain knowledge.\n\n*Next, let’s turn to how we use these benchmarks in practice when making decisions about AI systems.*\n\nUsing Benchmarks for Real-World Decisions\n\nBenchmarks can inform real-world AI decisions - like which model to deploy or where to invest R&D effort - but they should be used wisely. Here are some pragmatic tips and considerations:\n\nDon't pick a model solely by its leadership rank.\n\nIt's tempting to go to PapersWithCode, see which model is #1 on a benchmark, and choose it as 'best'. This can be a mistake if you neglect other factors, like:\n\n* **Relevance to Your Task**: Ensure the benchmark actually reflects your use case. For example, a model that’s state-of-the-art on academic QA (answering trivia questions) might not be the best for your customer support chatbot which needs a different style and real-time knowledge. If there’s a benchmark close to your domain (say, a biomedical QA benchmark for a medical assistant), weigh that more heavily.\n* **Robustness and Bias**: Leaderboards often rank by one metric. But consider secondary metrics or known issues. Is the top model known to be fragile or more prone to errors off the benchmark? Sometimes the #2 model might be nearly as good in accuracy but much more consistent or fair. For instance, if Model A has 90 on a benchmark and Model B 89, but you find Model A sometimes outputs unsavory biased text (and as such causing you more work in the long run), Model B might be preferable for deployment.\n\n* **Engineering Constraints**: The top benchmark model might be huge (billions of parameters requiring multiple GPUs and lots of memory). If you need something that runs on a CPU or a mobile device, a smaller model that’s a few points lower might actually give a better user experience. Benchmarks usually ignore this reality. It’s on you to evaluate efficiency as discussed. This is where benchmarks like MLPerf or doing your own speed tests come in. Always ask: Can I afford to run this model at the needed scale? If not, what’s the next best alternative?\n\n**Bottom line**: Benchmarks should inform your choice but not dictate it blindly. Think of them as one piece of the puzzle. Combine with other testing.\n\n*To interpret and act on AI benchmark data effectively, you need a strong foundation in data analytics. The* [*Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate*](https://imp.i384100.net/MAEENY) *offers hands-on training in tools and techniques essential for data-driven AI evaluation\\*.*\n\nUse benchmarks to narrow options, then validate on real data.\n\nA practical workflow:\n\n1. **Screen with Benchmarks**: Use public benchmark results to shortlist a few candidate models. For example, if you need an NLP model, maybe you pick the top 3 that have high SuperGLUE or MMLU scores and are available to use (some may be open-source, some via API).\n2. **Test on Your Task/Data**: Create a small custom benchmark or evaluation set that reflects your actual application (your domain-specific questions, images, user queries, etc.). Then evaluate those candidate models on it. Often you’ll find the differences from benchmarks might not fully hold – e.g. the model that was best on SuperGLUE might be only second-best on your data, but perhaps another model handles your particular content better. This real-world evaluation is gold. It can even just be manual testing: try the models on a variety of examples you care about.\n3. **Consider Fine-Tuning**: If you have some data, you might fine-tune a model to your task. In that case, initial benchmark leaderboards are less important than how much capacity the model has to learn. Still, a model that’s generally strong (high benchmark) usually fine-tunes well too. But occasionally a model with slightly lower general benchmark score might fine-tune *better* due to architecture or training style.\n4. **Monitor Over Time**: Once deployed, continue to monitor performance. Real-world data can drift; a model that was best initially might need an update or replacement if it starts failing relative to new state-of-the-art that handle new inputs better. Keep an eye on benchmark news but always verify improvements on your end.\n\nAvoid overreliance and benchmark gaming.\n\nOverreliance on benchmarks can lead to overfitting in a research sense. For example, a team might train a model to specifically excel on a benchmark by using test set tricks or other shortcuts – it tops the leaderboard but might be less useful in practice (since it’s tailored to that test). There’s a known phenomenon: “benchmark solving” where once a benchmark is treated as the target, people optimize for it in ways that don’t generalize. As a practitioner/decision-maker, be aware of this benchmark trap:\n\n* Check if the benchmark is still considered challenging or if it’s essentially solved (as SuperGLUE was by 2023). If solved, a new model boasting a slightly higher score isn’t that meaningful for real improvement.\n* Read papers or analyses for signs of **gaming**. For instance, if a benchmark allows submitting multiple runs, some teams might select the best run out of many (introducing a selection bias). Or they might use test data in training inadvertently. Usually, community commentary (on forums, etc.) will call out if a result seems fishy. The presence of **very high scores that jump suddenly** can be a red flag unless accompanied by a credible innovation.\n* Prefer models with **robust evaluation**. Most serious models now-a-days, in their technical report, don't just give one number; they provide a spectrum of evals (from coding to math to vision to adversarial tests). This holistic view is more reassuring than a single benchmark win. If someone claims “Model X is the best because it’s #1 on Benchmark Y,” it's purdent to understand how it fared on other related benchmarks. A truly strong model will generally perform well across many tests (unless it has been narrowly optimized for one).\n\nThe AI community is increasingly discussing *benchmark culture* and its pitfalls. Recognizing that the metric is not the mission is important. If your goal is a helpful AI assistant, a mix of benchmark-driven development and user feedback is key – not just chasing leaderboard glory.\n\nBenchmarks in Action\n\nTo make this more tangible, let’s look at a few illustrative scenarios of benchmark-driven decisions:\n\n* **Case 1: Choosing a Language Model for Customer Support** – Suppose a company wants an AI to help answer customer emails. They consider GPT-4, Claude 2, and a smaller open-source model. On pure language benchmarks, GPT-4 has the highest SuperGLUE/MMLU scores (indicating strong understanding). Claude 2 is slightly lower but known for longer context and a gentler style, and the open model is much lower on benchmarks. The company first uses these benchmarks to rule out any model that’s clearly underperforming (the open model scores ~70% where GPT-4 is ~85%, so they worry it may misunderstand too much). They then test GPT-4 vs Claude on actual customer emails. They find both do well, but GPT-4 answers are slightly more accurate and GPT-4 is more capable of handling edge cases (consistent with its higher reasoning benchmark scores). However, GPT-4 is also more costly. In the end, they choose GPT-4 for high-value queries and use Claude (fine-tuned on their support data) for less critical ones – a balanced decision informed by benchmarks but finalized by real-world trial.\n* **Case 2: Vision Model for Defect Detection** – An engineering team needs to detect product defects in images. They see that on ImageNet and COCO detection benchmarks, a certain EfficientNet-V2 and a new Vision Transformer are top performers (99% ImageNet, 60+ mAP on COCO). The Vision Transformer is better by 2 points mAP, but is twice as slow. They prototype both on some sample defect images. Both achieve nearly perfect accuracy on obvious defects; the harder part is speed on their production line. Given the minimal accuracy difference observed on their data, they go with EfficientNet-V2, which processes images fast enough for real-time use. They do keep an eye on the next MLPerf inference results to plan for hardware upgrades that might later allow using heavier models if needed.\n* **Case 3: Scaling Decision for a QA Service** – A startup is running a Q&A API using a 6-billion-parameter model they fine-tuned. They wonder if switching to a larger 30B model would yield significantly better answers. Looking at benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA, they see a jump from ~60% to ~70% going from 6B to 30B, and the latest 70B models hitting ~80%. It’s enticing, but doubling model size will increase their cloud costs and latency. They run an A/B test: the larger model indeed answers a bit more accurately especially on niche questions, matching the benchmark improvements. However, it’s slower and more expensive. They decide to offer it as a premium option for customers who need the extra boost (like research users), while keeping the smaller model for standard users. This way, benchmarks guided them on how much better bigger models are, but business considerations shaped the deployment.\n\nThese cases highlight a common theme: *benchmarks guide and inform, but real-world testing and constraints decide*.\n\nPerformance of Top AI Models on Benchmarks\n\nWe have several high-profile AI model families pushing the boundaries on benchmarks: OpenAI’s GPT-4 (and iterative GPT-4.x versions), Anthropic’s Claude 3, Google DeepMind’s Gemini, Meta’s open models (like LLaMA 3), and others like Mistral or PaLM. Here’s a snapshot of how the top models are performing on key benchmarks:\n\n* **GPT-4**: The GPT-4 model (launched 2023) set a new standard on many benchmarks. It achieved ~86.4% on MMLU, essentially reaching deep expert-level breadth. It also surpassed human-level on SuperGLUE (estimated ~90+ score) and has near-perfect scores on benchmarks like WinoGrande (commonsense reasoning) and SAT analogies. GPT-4’s coding ability is stellar – on HumanEval it solves the majority of problems (OpenAI reported >80% pass@1 in its technical report). It’s also highly capable in math and logical benchmarks, especially when allowed to use chain-of-thought prompting. The vision-enabled GPT-4 (GPT-4V) demonstrated strong performance on multimodal benchmarks: it’s near state-of-the-art on VQA and image captioning, though some specialized models like Google’s are slightly ahead on certain image tasks. Overall, GPT-4 is often the model to beat; even newer entrants compare themselves against GPT-4’s benchmark scores. For instance, one source describes a “GPT-4o” (an optimized or open variant) exceeding 85+ on multiple benchmarks including MMLU and HumanEval.\n* **Claude 3 (Anthropic)**: Claude’s third-generation model has significantly improved over Claude 2. On knowledge benchmarks like MMLU, Claude 3’s score is reported around the mid-80s (Claude 3 Opus variant scored ~84.6% on MMLU), basically tying or slightly trailing GPT-4. Claude is very strong in language understanding and scored highly on things like the ARC reasoning challenge and ethics tests. It’s known for a huge context window (100k+ tokens), which doesn’t directly show up in standard benchmark scores, but is an advantage in tasks requiring reading long documents. On coding, Claude 3 is competent but believed to be a bit behind GPT-4’s absolute performance (as suggested by some coding benchmarks where Claude might get, say, 70% vs GPT-4’s 80% on pass@1). In multi-turn dialogue benchmarks and human evaluations, Claude often scores well on helpfulness and harmlessness. In summary, Claude 3 is on par with GPT-4 on many NLP tasks, slightly behind on some reasoning extremes and coding, but offers other benefits like context length.\n* **Google’s Gemini**: Gemini is Google DeepMind’s answer to GPT-4, and it comes in variants like Gemini Nano, Pro, Ultra. According to Google, Gemini Ultra not only surpassed previous models on language benchmarks but integrated multimodal capabilities (text, images, audio, video). In practice, reports show Gemini Ultra scoring around 83-84% on MMLU, putting it very close to GPT-4. On multilingual tasks, Google claims strong results, given their expertise in translation. Where Gemini seems to shine is multimodal tasks: Google’s technical report (late 2024) indicated Gemini outperforms GPT-4 in tasks that combine modalities – for example, visual reasoning benchmarks like TextVQA and DocVQA (text in images) where Gemini had the edge. It also has demonstrated excellent code generation and tool use. One comparison noted Gemini achieved ~74.4% on a Python code benchmark vs 73.9% for GPT-4, essentially on par. Gemini’s architecture (reportedly a mixture-of-experts) also gives it efficiency gains, and its context window in the latest version is huge (even 1 million tokens in an experimental version). That doesn’t affect benchmark scores directly but is appealing for real applications.\n* **Other Notable Ones**:\n\n+ **PaLM 2 / PaLM 3 (Google)**: PaLM 2 was unveiled in 2023 and performed strongly on many benchmarks (improving translation and coding over previous Google models). By 2025, a PaLM 3 or similar might be part of Gemini or separate – likely also scoring in the 80s on MMLU and near top on others. Google has folded a lot into Gemini now.\n+ **Meta’s LLaMA Family**: LLaMA 2 (July 2023) was an open model that did well but below GPT-4 (e.g. ~68.9% MMLU for 70B version). Rumors or reports of LLaMA 3 or further iterations (with 200B+ parameters or optimized training) suggest open models closing the gap. Indeed, one report claimed a hypothetical “LLaMA 3.1 405B” model scored 86.6% on MMLU and even higher on some math/code benchmarks – essentially matching GPT-4. If verified, that means open-source is reaching parity in some areas by 2025. These large open models might not be widely accessible due to size, but smaller distilled versions are improving too.\n+ **Mistral, Falcon, etc.**: Several other open models exist (Mistral AI released 7B and 13B models in late 2023 claiming very strong performance for their size). They can’t match GPT-4 on absolute scores, but the gap per parameter is closing. E.g., a 13B model now might do what a 50B model did a year before on benchmarks.\n+ **GPT-4.5 or intermediate OpenAI models**: OpenAI continually refines models (e.g., ChatGPT got iterative upgrades like GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.). There was mention of GPT-4.5 being tested – one source indicated GPT-4.5 surpasses some older models on basic understanding but might not yet solve the hardest reasoning tasks. If released, it presumably bumps certain benchmarks even higher (maybe nudging MMLU closer to 90). OpenAI also had specialized models like code-davinci for coding, which presumably are incorporated into GPT-4’s capabilities now.\n\nIn summary, the state of play is that **multiple models have achieved near-human or beyond-human performance on many standard benchmarks**. GPT-4o remains a reference point, but Claude and Gemini are very close competitors, and even some open models claim comparable scores on key tests. Differences of a few points exist on various benchmarks, but all these frontier models are extremely capable. This means for end-users, the choice might come down to factors outside of just raw benchmark numbers – such as cost, context length, fine-tuning ability, or company trust. It’s also worth noting that as models saturate benchmarks like SuperGLUE or MMLU, the community is already moving to new challenges (as listed in emerging benchmarks). Staying current with these trends is important for anyone relying on AI.\n\nStaying Current with Benchmarks\n\nThe AI benchmark landscape evolves quickly. To stay up-to-date and ensure this guide remains useful, here are some tips and resources:\n\n* **Follow Leaderboards on Papers With Code**: Websites like PapersWithCode maintain up-to-date leaderboards for countless benchmarks (e.g., you can see SOTA on GLUE, SuperGLUE, ImageNet, etc., along with papers/models). This is incredibly useful to track if a new model has taken the top spot or if a benchmark has been essentially solved. We recommend bookmarking relevant tasks on PapersWithCode.\n* **Check MLCommons (MLPerf) Results**: MLCommons releases new benchmark results periodically (for training and inference). Their official site and press releases will show the latest records in speed/throughput, giving insight into hardware progress. If you care about deploying models efficiently, these results are gold.\n* **Monitor AI Index Reports**: The Stanford AI Index (an annual report) includes chapters on technical performance, often with charts of benchmark progress over time. The 2025 report, for example, highlights how quickly models saturated benchmarks and which areas still lag. It’s a great high-level overview, updated yearly.\n* **Community and Conferences**: Many benchmarks originate or are announced in academic papers (NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, etc.). Following those conferences or their proceedings can clue you in to new benchmarks or evaluations gaining traction (for example, a workshop on robustness might release a new benchmark dataset). Also, following AI communities on forums or social media (Reddit’s r/MachineLearning, Twitter AI discussions) often surfaces benchmark news – e.g., someone posts “Model X just broke the record on Y benchmark.”\n* [**The AI Navigator**](https://www.theainavigator.com/): We plan to update this guide regularly as new benchmarks emerge or new state-of-the-art results are achieved. The aim is to keep the advice pragmatic as the field changes. For instance, if a “GLUE 3.0” or a new multimodal benchmark suite becomes the standard, we’ll include it in future revisions. Consider this a living document – check back on The AI Navigator for updated editions.\n\nStaying current matters because benchmarks often foreshadow what soon becomes possible in products. If you see a model now dominates a reasoning benchmark that no previous model could crack, it’s a sign something qualitatively new might be available (and perhaps you can leverage it in your applications). Conversely, if benchmarks start focusing on areas like fairness or energy, it indicates the industry’s priorities shifting – which could align with regulatory or consumer expectations.\n\n...\n\nIn conclusion, AI benchmarks are powerful tools to gauge and drive progress. They have propelled AI from sub-human performance to super-human on many tasks in a remarkably short time. (Our [AI Timeline](https://www.theainavigator.com/ai-timeline) illustrates this beautifully.) By understanding what benchmarks measure (and what they don’t), using them judiciously to guide your decisions, and keeping abreast of the latest developments, you can navigate the fast-moving world of AI with confidence. Remember that benchmarks are means to an end – better AI systems – and not the end themselves. Use them as a compass, but always keep your true north (the real-world impact and correctness of AI) in sight.\n\nHappy benchmarking!\n\nGlossary of AI Benchmarking Terms\n\n(See also our broader and [extensive glossary of AI Terms and concepts](https://www.theainavigator.com/#ai-glossary).)\n\n* **Benchmark**: A standardized test or set of tasks used to evaluate and compare AI model performance. E.g. ImageNet for image classification, GLUE for NLP.\n* **GLUE/SuperGLUE**: Benchmark suites for **General Language Understanding**.

Accuracy ~80%+ for SOTA models.\n* **MLPerf**: A set of benchmarks focusing on **speed and efficiency** (training and inference) on tasks like image classification, NLP, etc.. Used to rank hardware/software systems rather than model accuracy.\n* **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions. Common metric for classification and QA.\n* **Precision/Recall**: Precision = % of model’s positive predictions that were correct; Recall = % of actual positives that the model identified.

A balanced metric for classification performance (1.0 is perfect).\n* **BLEU**: A metric for text generation (especially translation) based on overlapping n-grams with reference text. Higher is better (0-100).\n* **ROUGE**: Metric for summarization (overlap with reference summary). Often reported as ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L (for unigrams, bigrams, longest common subsequence).\n* **Benchmark Saturation**: When a benchmark is essentially “solved” by models (performance near max or human-level), making it no longer useful to distinguish models.\n* **Leaderboard**: The ranking of model results on a benchmark (often hosted on websites). Climbing the leaderboard is a common goal in model development.\n* **Overfitting (to a benchmark)**: When a model or researcher tunes too specifically to the test set, leading to high benchmark scores but poor generalization.\n* **State-of-the-Art (SOTA)**: The current best performance achieved on a task or benchmark.\n* **Zero-shot/Few-shot**: Evaluation where a model gets zero examples (just the task prompt) or a few examples (few-shot) before being tested on a task.

If you care about how fast models train or run on different hardware (TPUs vs GPUs, etc.), this is the go-to source.\n\n**Stanford HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)**: [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/) is a framework/benchmark by Stanford that evaluates language models across many dimensions (accuracy, calibration, bias, toxicity, etc.) with a unified approach. It’s not a single number benchmark but a report card. You can see detailed comparisons of popular models. A great resource for multidimensional evaluation.\n\n**AI Index Report**: The **Stanford AI Index** (annual) compiles many benchmark trends and metrics. The [2025 report](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report), for example, has charts of SuperGLUE and MMLU progress. It’s a free PDF (hai.stanford.edu).\n\n**Academic Leaderboard Sites**: Some benchmarks have their own official sites: e.g., [super.gluebenchmark.com](http://super.gluebenchmark.com) (SuperGLUE leaderboard), [gluebenchmark.com](http://gluebenchmark.com) (GLUE), [paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet](http://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet) (ImageNet SOTA list), etc. Visiting these can give more context and links to model papers.\n\n**Community Resources**: Blogs and analyses by AI companies often explain benchmarks in clear and simple terms. E.g., [DeepGram’s blog on MMLU](https://deepgram.com/learn/mmlu-llm-benchmark-guide) or Arize’s “[40 LLM Benchmarks](https://arize.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-mmlu-codexglue-gsm8k)” post list many benchmarks and what they mean. These can be useful to grasp the landscape beyond the few we covered.\n\n**Tools for Custom Benchmarking**: If you plan to benchmark models yourself, tools like [EleutherAI’s Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://www.eleuther.ai/projects/large-language-model-evaluation) or [OpenAI’s Evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) can help run standard tests (many are open-source on GitHub). Also, CarperAI’s TRLX and others allow reinforcement learning fine-tuning with human feedback if you want to optimize beyond just static benchmarks.\n\n**Dynamic and Adversarial Benchmarks**: Keep an eye on efforts like [Dynabench](https://research.facebook.com/publications/dynabench-rethinking-benchmarking-in-nlp/) (by Meta) which create dynamic benchmarks where models and humans interact (models are continually challenged by new human-written test cases). And the [BIG-bench collaboration](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) for creative tasks. These point to the future of benchmarking when static tests become too easy.\n\n**Regulatory Guidance**: Interestingly, even policymakers reference benchmarks now (the EU AI Act mentions using standardized benchmarks for assessment). Organizations like NIST are working on AI evaluation standards. Following their releases can hint at what benchmarks might become officially required in certain contexts (e.g., safety-critical AI might need to pass certain robustness tests).\n\n[Previous](https://www.theainavigator.com/blog/exclusive-launch-the-ai-navigator-pop-up-merch-store-is-live)\n\n[Exclusive Launch: The AI Navigator Pop-Up Merch Store Is...](https://www.theainavigator.com/blog/exclusive-launch-the-ai-navigator-pop-up-merch-store-is-live)\n\n[Next](https://www.theainavigator.com/blog/what-is-kiro-ai)\n\n[What is Kiro AI?](https://www.theainavigator.com/blog/what-is-kiro-ai)\n\n[Return to site](https://www.theainavigator.com/_blog#_blog)\n\nCookie Use\n\nWe use cookies to improve browsing experience, security, and data collection.

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ["# Key Benchmark Scores and Metrics\n\nThe evaluation of language models, particularly large language models (LLMs), is crucial for understanding their capabilities and guiding their development. This section delves into key benchmark scores and metrics used to assess LLM performance, providing an overview of commonly used benchmarks, a detailed analysis of key metrics, and a critical assessment of their limitations. By exploring these facets, we can better comprehend how LLMs are evaluated and the implications of these evaluations.\n\n## Overview of Commonly Used Benchmark Scores\n\nIn the field of natural language processing (NLP), various benchmark scores serve as standardized metrics for evaluating the performance of language models. These scores offer a framework for comparing different models across tasks, ensuring that improvements in model architectures and training methodologies can be quantified effectively. \n\n### Key Metrics\nSome of the most commonly used benchmark scores include:\n\n- **Accuracy**: A straightforward metric that measures the proportion of correct predictions made by a model compared to the total number of predictions. While useful in classification tasks, it does not account for the distribution of classes, which can misrepresent model performance.\n\n- **F1 Score**: This metric combines precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. It is particularly useful in scenarios where class distributions are imbalanced, as it gives equal weight to false positives and false negatives, thus offering a more nuanced view of performance.\n\n- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: Primarily used for evaluating machine translation, BLEU measures how many words and phrases in the generated text match the reference translations, thereby quantifying the quality of the output. Its reliance on n-grams can lead to limitations in understanding semantic equivalence, especially in languages with flexibility in word order.\n\n- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: Commonly employed in summarization tasks, ROUGE assesses the overlap of n-grams between the generated summary and reference summaries, focusing on recall. This metric is beneficial for evaluating the comprehensiveness of summarization but may overlook the quality of the generated text.\n\n- **Perplexity**: A measure of how well a probability distribution predicts a sample, where lower values indicate better performance. It is often used in language modeling to evaluate how well a model can predict the next word in a sequence.\n\nThese metrics provide a foundational understanding of model performance, but they often present a limited view of a model's capabilities, necessitating deeper analysis through specialized benchmarks.\n\n## Detailed Analysis of Key Benchmarks\n\nSeveral benchmarks have gained prominence in evaluating LLMs, each designed to measure different aspects of language understanding and generation. Below, we discuss some of the most notable benchmarks: GLUE, SuperGLUE, and SQuAD.\n\n### GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)\n\nGLUE is a collection of nine diverse tasks designed to evaluate models on a range of language understanding challenges, including sentiment analysis, linguistic acceptability, and textual entailment. The GLUE scores are compiled from the performance across these tasks, averaged to provide a single score that reflects a model's overall language understanding capabilities. \n\nInterpreting GLUE scores involves not only looking at the aggregate performance but also analyzing individual task scores to identify strengths and weaknesses in specific areas of language understanding. This nuanced analysis helps developers understand where improvements are needed.\n\n### SuperGLUE\n\nBuilding on the foundation of GLUE, SuperGLUE was introduced to address the limitations of its predecessor. SuperGLUE consists of more challenging tasks and includes advanced language understanding problems such as reading comprehension and commonsense reasoning. As the name implies, SuperGLUE aims to push the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve.\n\nScores from SuperGLUE are designed to be more informative, particularly as they provide insights into how models perform on tasks that require a deeper understanding of context and nuance. The benchmark also includes a leaderboard that highlights state-of-the-art performance, facilitating comparisons across models and encouraging continual advancements.\n\n### SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)\n\nSQuAD is focused specifically on the task of question answering. It provides a set of questions based on a collection of Wikipedia articles, where models must extract the correct answers from the text. SQuAD scores are determined based on exact match (EM) and F1 scores, assessing both the precision of the answers and their completeness.\n\nSQuAD has been pivotal in advancing the field of question answering, as it challenges models to understand context and retrieve information accurately. The structured nature of the benchmark allows for clear interpretation of how well a model can comprehend and process natural language, contributing substantially to the development of more sophisticated question-answering systems.\n\n## Limitations of Current Benchmarking Practices\n\nDespite their utility, current benchmarking practices face several limitations that can hinder the accurate assessment of LLMs. One major challenge is the reliance on surface-level metrics, which may not fully capture a model's understanding of language. For instance, a model might achieve high accuracy on a benchmark while lacking genuine comprehension of the nuances of language.\n\n### Specific Challenges Include\n1. **Dataset Constraints**: Many benchmarks are limited by their datasets, which may not represent real-world diversity. This can lead to models that perform well in benchmark evaluations but poorly in practical applications, where language use is more varied and complex.\n\n2. **Overfitting to Benchmarks**: There is a risk of models being optimized to perform well on specific tasks rather than developing a robust understanding of language. This can result in models excelling in benchmark scores but struggling to generalize effectively to new, unseen tasks.\n\n3. **Dynamic Nature of Language**: As language evolves, benchmarks may become outdated, failing to reflect contemporary language usage and the capabilities of modern LLMs.\n\n4. **Bias in Evaluation**: Some benchmarks may favor certain types of model architectures, leading to skewed results that do not accurately represent overall model performance.\n\n5. **Human Evaluation Limitations**: While human evaluation can provide valuable insights, it is resource-intensive and can suffer from inconsistencies due to subjective judgments.\n\n6. **Benchmark Leakage**: There is a potential for models to be trained on benchmark data, which can artificially inflate performance scores and misrepresent the model's true capabilities.\n\nGiven these limitations, it is crucial to adopt a balanced approach that considers both benchmark scores and real-world performance to achieve more reliable assessments of language models and their capabilities."], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='common benchmark scores in LLM evaluation'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.codecademy.com/article/llm-evaluation-metrics-benchmarks-best-practices', title='LLM Evaluation: Metrics, Benchmarks & Best Practices - Codecademy', raw_content="[Skip to Content](#heading)\n\n[Articles](/articles)\n\n# LLM Evaluation: Metrics, Benchmarks & Best Practices\n\n[Large language models (LLMs)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/ai/foundation-models/large-language-models) have transformed the way we research, write, and code.

LLM evaluation goes beyond simply checking whether the model generates grammatically correct sentences. It helps us measure a model’s performance on a specific task, ensure the safety and trustworthiness of the model outputs, and compare different models.\n\nTo evaluate LLMs, we use different methods, metrics, and benchmarks. It is important to choose the right metric and benchmark for evaluating LLM outputs during evaluation. For example, we cannot use the same metric to evaluate two different LLMs trained for summarization and paraphrasing tasks. Each task requires separate tests to understand how the model will perform in a real-world scenario.\n\nWe need to understand the different evaluation methodologies, metrics, and benchmarks to evaluate LLMs efficiently. Let’s start with the methodologies.\n\n## LLM evaluation methodologies\n\nEffective LLM evaluation frameworks use different methodologies depending on the task and available resources. The primary LLM evaluation approaches include metric-based evaluation, human-based assessment, LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, and benchmark-based evaluation, each offering unique advantages for measuring model performance.\n\n### Metric-based evaluation\n\nMetric-based evaluation methods consist of automated tests to evaluate LLM outputs. In these methods, we use different computational metrics to score model outputs against references.\n\n* We use lexical overlap metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR for tasks like translation and summarization.\n* We use semantic similarity metrics like BERTScore and MoverScore for tasks like paraphrasing and summarization.\n\nMetric-based evaluation is a quick and objective method to evaluate LLMs. However, it doesn’t capture how the LLMs perform in tasks that require reasoning, common sense, and natural language inference. To evaluate LLMs for these aspects, we use benchmarks.\n\n### Benchmark-based evaluation\n\nBenchmarks are a set of tasks that we use to evaluate LLMs for different aspects, such as natural language understanding, reasoning, reading comprehension, truthfulness, etc. Benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, SQuAD, and ARC help us evaluate LLMs for tasks that cannot be evaluated using metric-based methods.\n\nBenchmarks perform better in evaluating LLMs. However, they don’t capture whether the LLM output is fluent, factual, and free from bias. We use human evaluation to evaluate LLM outputs for coherence, fluency, factuality, and bias.\n\n### Human evaluation\n\nIn human evaluation, human judges are directly employed to rate LLM outputs based on different parameters. To evaluate the LLM output, the human judges use various parameters and rate the model output from 1 to 5 or 0 to 1. The average score of all the human judges is considered the LLM’s score for a particular parameter. Some of the popular parameters we use to evaluate LLMs using human judges are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Aspect |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Fluency** | Is the LLM output natural and grammatically correct? |\n| **Coherence** | Do sentences in the output connect logically? |\n| **Factuality** | Is the information in the output factually correct? |\n| **Helpfulness** | Does the output answer the question fully? |\n| **Safety & Bias** | Does the LLM avoid harmful content? |\n\nHuman evaluation evaluates LLM outputs for aspects that are difficult to measure using automated metrics and benchmarks. It is important to include humans in the LLM evaluation process. However, human evaluation is slow and costly. Hence, we should combine automatic metrics, human ratings, and benchmark scores for a robust LLM evaluation process.\n\n### LLM-as-a-judge evaluation\n\nInstead of relying on humans, we can use LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini to evaluate outputs from other LLMs. ChatGPT and Gemini are trained on web-scale datasets and possess reasoning capabilities as they are trained using techniques like [chain-of-thought prompting](https://www.codecademy.com/article/chain-of-thought-cot-prompting). Hence, we can use them as judges to evaluate other LLMs by providing them with context and reference texts. This will allow us to evaluate thousands of LLM outputs quickly without needing large human annotation teams while still delivering reasonably reliable assessments.\n\nHaving a brief idea of the evaluation methodologies, let’s discuss the different LLM evaluation metrics and benchmarks.\n\n## LLM evaluation metrics\n\nLLM evaluation metrics evaluate an LLM’s output based on a specified criterion. These metrics help us quantify the different properties of LLM’s output, such as correctness, hallucination, semantic relevance, etc.\n\n### BLEU\n\nBilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) is a metric we use to evaluate the quality of a text generated by a machine. To assess an LLM’s response using BLEU, we need reference outputs for every input given to the LLM. *BLEU measures how similar the LLM-generated output is to the reference text.* For this, it creates sequences of words of length n (n-grams) from the output text and checks how many of the generated n-grams appear in the reference text.\n\nBLEU scores range from 0 to 1, where 1 suggests a perfect match of the LLM output with the reference and 0 represents no overlap. BLEU focuses on precision and evaluates how much of the LLM output is correct compared to the reference. We can use BLEU to evaluate LLM outputs in summarization, translation, and question-answering tasks.\n\n### ROUGE\n\nRecall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) consists of metrics for evaluating LLM’s outputs using reference texts. *ROUGE measures how much of the content from the reference text is present in the LLM output.* We calculate the ROUGE score by dividing the number of common words, phrases, or n-grams between the reference and output text by the total words, phrases, or n-grams in the reference text.\n\nROUGE scores also range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a good output. ROUGE is recall-oriented and measures how much of the reference content is present in the LLM output. ROUGE is widely used to evaluate LLMs for text summarization tasks.\n\n### METEOR\n\nMetric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ordering (METEOR) improves on BLEU and ROUGE to evaluate the quality of LLM output using reference texts. Like BLEU or ROUGE, METEOR measures exact matches of words and phrases. However, it also measures words with the same root (stemming matches) and words with similar meaning (synonym matches).\n\nWe use the following steps while evaluating the LLM output with METEOR:\n\n* We first calculate the precision, i.e., the ratio of the number of common words between the LLM output and the reference text to the total number of words in the LLM output.\n* Next, we calculate recall, i.e., the ratio of the number of common words between the LLM output and the reference text to the total number of words in the reference text.\n* After calculating precision and recall, we calculate the F1 Score, i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n* Finally, we add a penalty to the F1 Score based on the difference in the order of the words in the LLM output and the reference text to get the final METEOR score.\n\nUnlike BLEU and ROUGE, METEOR understands synonyms and word variations in the LLM output and better aligns with human judgment. However, these metrics depend on word overlap and statistical analysis of the text, not semantic meaning. We can use vector embeddings of the reference text and the LLM output to measure semantic similarity between them. For this, we can use BERTScore.\n\n### BERTScore\n\nWe use BERTScore to measure the semantic similarity between the reference text and LLM output while evaluating LLMs. To use BERTScore, we first tokenize the reference text and the LLM output and generate their embeddings using models like BERT or RoBERTa. Then, we compute the similarity between each candidate word embedding and each reference word embedding using cosine similarity. For each token in the LLM output, we find the most similar token in the reference text using precision and recall.\n\n* Precision determines how well the words in the LLM output are covered by reference words *in meaning*. To calculate precision, we find the most similar token in the reference text for each token in the LLM output. Then, we take the average of the maximum similarity scores for all the tokens in the LLM output.\n* Recall determines how well the reference words are covered by the words in the LLM output *in meaning*. To calculate recall, we find the most similar token in the LLM output for each token in the reference text. Then, we take the average of the maximum similarity scores for all the tokens in the reference text.\n\nAfter calculating precision and recall, we calculate the F1 Score by taking their harmonic mean, which is termed the BERTScore.\n\n### MoverScore\n\nMoverScore evaluates LLM outputs against a reference text using the text embeddings. In this technique, we first create vector embeddings for the LLM output and the reference text. Then, we use the earth mover distance to calculate the dissimilarity between the LLM output and the reference text. The more the distance, the more the LLM output is semantically different from the reference text.\n\n### Factuality\n\nFactuality measures how well an LLM output aligns with facts. LLM applications can hallucinate and produce incorrect outputs. Hence, evaluating the LLM output’s truthfulness is important using human evaluation and automated metrics.\n\n* In human evaluation, we check whether each statement in the LLM output is factually correct with respect to a reference document. However, this is costly and time-consuming.\n* We can use natural language inference (NLI) models to check if a given text in the LLM output is entailed or supported by the reference text.\n* We can also create question-answer pairs from the LLM output and use the reference text to answer the questions. If the answers match, we can establish the factuality of the LLM output.\n\nYou can use models like [FactCC](https://huggingface.co/manueldeprada/FactCC),[SummaC](https://github.com/tingofurro/summac), and [QAGS](https://github.com/W4ngatang/qags) to measure the factuality of a summary with reference to a reference text.\n\n## LLM evaluation benchmarks\n\nLLM evaluation benchmarks are a set of tasks and datasets for evaluating LLMs. Let’s start with GLUE and discuss different benchmarks, such as SUPERGLUE, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, SQuAD, and ARC.\n\n### GLUE\n\nWe use the [General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmark to evaluate how well an LLM understands natural language. GLUE consists of [nine datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue) and tasks that cover different aspects of natural language. All the tasks are divided into three categories, i.e., single-sentence tasks, similarity and paraphrase tasks, and inference tasks.\n\n#### Single-sentence tasks\n\n[Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)](https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/) and [Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/sst2) are single-sentence tasks in GLUE.\n\n* CoLA is used to decide if a sentence in LLM output is grammatically acceptable. The [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shivkumarganesh/CoLA) contains a sequence of words and a label showing whether the sentence is grammatically correct.\n* The SST-2 dataset contains sentences extracted from movie reviews and their sentiment labels, which we can use to evaluate LLMs for sentiment analysis tasks.\n\n#### Similarity and paraphrase tasks\n\nGLUE has [Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)](https://github.com/magsail/MRPC), [Quora Question Pairs (QQP)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-question-pairs/), and [Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/stsb) datasets to evaluate LLMs for similarity and paraphrase tasks.\n\n* The [MRPC dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/mrpc) contains sentence pairs and a label to denote whether they are semantically equivalent.\n* The [QQP dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/qqp) contains question pairs from Quora, with a label showing if the questions are duplicates.\n* The STS-B dataset contains sentence pairs with human-annotated similarity scores between 0 and 1, which indicate whether the sentences have the same meaning.\n\nWe can use MRPC, STS-B, and QQP to evaluate LLMs for paraphrasing and semantic understanding tasks.\n\n#### Natural language inference tasks\n\nFor natural language inference, GLUE provides [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/mnli), [Question Answering Natural Language Inference (QNLI)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/qnli), [Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/rte), and [Winograd Schema Challenge(WNLI)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/wnli) datasets.\n\n* The MNLI dataset contains premise and hypothesis sentence pairs with a classification label showing entailment, neutrality, or contradiction between the premise and hypothesis.\n* RTE contains premise and hypothesis sentence pairs with a classification label showing entailment or no entailment between the premise and hypothesis.\n* WNLI is similar to RTE. However, it contains a complex reading comprehension task in which the LLM needs to figure out what a pronoun refers to to decide whether the premise and hypthesis show entailment or no entailment.\n* The QNLI dataset contains question-paragraph pairs with a label showing whether or not one of the sentences in the paragraph contains the answer to the question.\n\nGLUE provides a robust mechanism for evaluating LLM outputs using all these datasets and tasks. Each task checks a different skill in language understanding, and an LLM’s overall score tells us how good the model really is.\n\nWith continuous improvement, models like BERT and RoBERTa efficiently solved tasks in the GLUE framework. Hence, SuperGLUE was introduced to test LLMs for deeper reasoning, commonsense, and more challenging NLP tasks that GLUE couldn’t assess.\n\n### SuperGLUE\n\nThe [Super General Language Understanding Evaluation (SuperGLUE)](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) benchmark contains eight tasks that evaluate LLMs on different parameters.\n\n* The [Boolean Questions (BoolQ)](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/boolean-questions) dataset contains a paragraph, a question, and a boolean (Yes/No) answer to the question that tests the LLM for reading comprehension and factual reasoning.\n* The [CommitmentBank (CB)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/cb) dataset contains premise and hypothesis sentence pairs and a label showing entailment, neutrality, or contradiction.\n* [Choice of Plausible Alternatives(COPA)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/copa) contains a premise and two choices where one of the choices is the cause or effect of the premise. It tests the LLM’s causal reasoning abilities.\n* [Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension (MultiRC)](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/multirc/) contains multi-sentence paragraphs, a question, and some answer options where one or more answers can be correct. The LLM has to predict the correct and incorrect answers. [MultiRC](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/multirc) checks for LLM’s deep comprehension abilities between multiple sentences.\n* [Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning (ReCoRD)](https://sheng-z.github.io/ReCoRD-explorer/) consists of passages from news articles along with a query with a missing entity. The LLM needs to find the missing entity in the query by analyzing the passage in the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/record).\n* The [Word-in-Context(WiC)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/wic) dataset contains two sentences with a common word, and the LLM has to identify if the given word has the same meaning in both the sentences.\n* The [WSC (Winograd Schema Challenge)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/wsc) dataset contains a sentence, an entity from the sentence, a pronoun, and a label showing if the pronoun refers to the given entity. The WNLI dataset used in GLUE is a reformulated version of WSC.\n* The RTE dataset, which is also known as [Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/), is the same as that used in the GLUE benchmark.\n\nSuperGLUE is better than GLUE for evaluating LLMs for comprehension, reasoning, commonsense, and multi-sentence understanding tasks, and it remains the gold standard for evaluating LLMs.\n\n### HellaSwag\n\nThe [HellaSwag](https://github.com/rowanz/hellaswag) benchmark was built to evaluate the commonsense reasoning abilities of LLMs. The [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rowan/hellaswag) contains a sentence, a list of possible endings, and the label denoting the actual ending. HellaSwag checks if an LLM can choose the most sensible continuation of the sentence beyond grammar or word overlap.\n\n### TruthfulQA\n\n[TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) is a benchmark for evaluating if LLMs give factually correct answers or mirror common misconceptions, false beliefs, or biased statements. The TruthfulQA [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/domenicrosati/TruthfulQA) contains a question, the best answer for the question, a list of correct answers, and a list of incorrect answers. Using the questions and the LLM output, we can evaluate the truthfulness and factuality of the answers given by the LLM.\n\n### SQuAD\n\n[Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is the benchmark to evaluate LLMs for machine reading comprehension. The [SQuAD dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkar/squad) contains a paragraph, a question for which the answer is present in the given paragraph, and the answer to the question. The LLM needs to answer the question based on the information provided in the paragraph. The QNLI dataset used in the GLUE benchmark is also derived from SQuAD.\n\n### ARC\n\nAI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) is a multiple-choice question-answering benchmark. The [ARC dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc) contains questions, multiple choices for the answer, and an answer key containing the correct answer. It tests whether LLMs can apply reasoning and scientific knowledge instead of memorization and word matching.\n\nAs we have discussed different metrics and benchmarks to evaluate LLMs, let’s discuss the advantages of evaluating large language models.\n\n## Advantages of LLM evaluation\n\nEvaluating LLMs using different metrics and benchmarks helps us understand how they perform in different tasks. The following are some of the advantages of LLM evaluation.\n\n* **Measuring model quality**: LLM evaluation helps us check whether the LLM can produce accurate and relevant outputs for a given use case. Without evaluation, we might be unable to decide whether a given model is suitable for a particular task.\n* **Fair comparison between LLMs**: Benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE give us a standardized setup for evaluating LLMs. We can use the performance of LLMs on these benchmarks to decide if one is better than another for the given set of tasks.\n* **Identifying an LLM’s strengths and weaknesses**: An LLM might be good at paraphrasing, but it might not work well for question-answering tasks. LLM evaluation helps us identify an LLM’s strengths and weaknesses so that we can use the model in tasks where it performs best.\n* **Progress in AI research and development**: With insight into an LLM’s weaknesses, we can develop new models to overcome the shortcomings. Similarly, if an LLM becomes excellent at a given benchmark, we can build more complex tasks and benchmarks to evaluate LLMs and drive progress.\n* **Reliability and safety**: Different benchmarks give us an insight into an LLM’s reasoning and comprehension abilities. With benchmarks like TruthfulQA, we can assess if an LLM can generate outputs free from bias or misconceptions. Hence, LLM evaluation helps ensure reliability and safety in LLM applications.\n\nWhile LLM evaluation has many benefits, it also has several challenges. Let’s discuss some of these challenges.\n\n## Challenges in LLM evaluation\n\nWe face several technical and procedural challenges while evaluating LLMs. The following are some of the challenges in evaluating large language models.\n\n* **Benchmark saturation**: LLMs have become very good at solving tasks in earlier benchmarks like GLUE and SQuAD and often outperform humans. However, it doesn’t mean that they have become truly intelligent. As the benchmark datasets get included in the training dataset of new LLMs, we need to devise new benchmarks that can objectively evaluate LLMs.\n* **Narrow coverage in benchmarks**: Unlike GLUE and SuperGLUE, most benchmarks evaluate models for a specific task or aspect. An LLM can excel at HellaSwag but struggle in TruthfulQA. Hence, it is important to evaluate LLMs for different benchmarks to establish their reliability in real-world applications.\n* **Costly human evaluation**: We need human judges to evaluate LLMs for fluency, coherence, helpfulness, and bias. Human evaluation is expensive, slow, and subjective. There is also an inherent risk of biased human judges, who can rate unsafe or biased outputs as safe. Hence, it is essential to standardize the human evaluation process.\n* **Lack of real-world alignment**: Benchmarks and evaluation metrics don’t capture how people use LLMs. A model that performs well on benchmarks can still give incorrect or biased outputs in real-world scenarios.\n\nHaving discussed the advantages and challenges of LLM evaluation, let’s discuss some of the best practices for evaluating LLMs that can help you maximize advantages and overcome the challenges.\n\n## LLM evaluation best practices\n\nLLM evaluation is a complex process, and we must avoid any mistakes that can make the results unfair or misleading. The following are some of the LLM evaluation best practices you can use to evaluate LLMs in a better manner:\n\n* **Use multiple metrics and benchmarks**: An LLM can excel on a benchmark but struggle with another. Therefore, we should evaluate LLMs across different metrics and benchmarks before deciding on the quality of the model.\n* **Use standard datasets and benchmarks**: We shouldn’t rely on ad hoc and less reproducible methods and datasets to evaluate LLMs. Always use established benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, TruthfulQA, SQuAD, HellaSwag, etc, for LLM evaluation.\n* **Check for overfitting**: It is possible that an LLM memorizes the publicly available benchmark dataset or is fine-tuned for a particular benchmark. To avoid misjudgement, we should use out-of-distribution tests and adversarial examples. For example, you can paraphrase the question in the SQuaD or QNLI dataset to check if an LLM can comprehend the question or has just memorized the answers from the training dataset.\n* **Combine metric-based and human evaluation**: Human and metric-based evaluations work differently. Automated tests like GLUE or SuperGLUE are fast but lack tests for fluency, helpfulness, safety, and bias. Human evaluation can help assess LLMs on these subjective criteria, even if it’s an expensive and slow method. Hence, we should combine human evaluation and automated evaluation methodologies to better assess the LLMs.\n* **Include bias, fairness, and safety checks**: We should explicitly test the LLMs for harmful content, stereotypes, or unsafe responses. This is important for real-world deployment, as biased and harmful responses can lead to economic and reputation loss for any given organization using the LLM.\n* **Adopt continuous evaluation**: We should continuously evaluate and improve LLMs using user feedback, A/B testing, and [reinforcement learning](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-reinforcement-learning-with-examples) so that the model performs well in real-world situations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs LLMs continue to be adopted in business, education, healthcare, and other domains, rigorous evaluation is required to ensure they remain accurate, safe, and reliable. By systematically assessing an LLM’s accuracy, reasoning, safety, and real-world usefulness, we can ensure that the model serves the intended purpose responsibly.\n\nIn this article, we discussed LLM evaluation methodologies, metrics, and benchmarks. We also discussed the advantages, challenges, and best practices for LLM evaluation.

Is a higher BLEU score better?\n\nYes, a higher BLEU score is better as it indicates that the LLM output is more similar to the reference text, which is good.\n\n### 2. What are the most important benchmarks for LLM evaluation?\n\nLLM evaluation benchmarks are standardized tasks and datasets to test LLMs for causal reasoning, natural language inference, and real-world usefulness. The most important LLM evaluation benchmarks within modern evaluation frameworks include GLUE and SuperGLUE for language understanding, HellaSwag for commonsense reasoning, TruthfulQA for factual accuracy, and MMLU for multitask performance.\n\n### 3. What is golden dataset for LLM evaluation?\n\nA golden dataset for LLM evaluation is a curated and labeled dataset we use as ground truth to evaluate the performance of large language models. Presently, SuperGLUE is the gold standard benchmark for LLM evaluation, containing eight datasets for different tasks, such as reading comprehension, factual reasoning, and natural language inference.\n\n### 4. What is the difference between LLM model evaluation and system evaluation?\n\nLLM model evaluation only tests the LLM’s comprehension, reasoning, and inference capabilities. LLM system evaluation includes integrating testing, load testing, security testing, and usability testing to test the entire LLM application for latency, scalability, security, and user-friendliness in a real-world setting.\n\n### 5. What is the goal of regression testing in LLM evaluations?\n\nRegression testing checks whether an application’s old features work correctly after new changes. We use regression testing in LLM evaluations to ensure that model updates, prompt updates, or algorithm changes do not impact the LLM’s existing functionalities and performance.\n\nCodecademy Team\n\n'The Codecademy Team, composed of experienced educators and tech experts, is dedicated to making tech skills accessible to all.

These benchmarks consist of sample data, a set of questions or tasks to test LLMs on specific skills, metrics for evaluating performance and a scoring mechanism.\n\nModels are benchmarked based on their capabilities, such as coding, common sense and reasoning. Other capabilities encompass [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing), including machine translation, question answering and [text summarization](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/text-summarization).\n\nLLM benchmarks play a crucial role in developing and enhancing models. Benchmarks showcase the progress of an LLM as it learns, with quantitative measures that highlight where the model excels and its areas for improvement.\n\nThis in turn guides the [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) process, which helps LLM researchers and developers advance the field. LLM benchmarks also provide an objective comparison of different models, helping inform software developers and organizations as they choose which models better suit their needs.\n\n## How LLM benchmarks work\n\nLLM benchmarks operate in a straightforward manner. They supply a task that an LLM must accomplish, evaluate model performance according to a certain metric and produce a score based on that metric. Here’s how each step works in detail:\n\n### Setting up\n\nLLM benchmarks already have sample data prepared—coding challenges, large documents, math problems, real-world conversations, science questions. A range of tasks are also at the ready, including commonsense reasoning, problem-solving, question answering, summary generation and translation. These are all given to the model at the outset of testing.\n\n### Testing\n\nWhen running the benchmark, it’s introduced to a model in one of three approaches:\n\n* [Few-shot](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/few-shot-learning): Before prompting an LLM to perform a task, it’s supplied with a small number of examples showing how to fulfill that task. This demonstrates a model’s ability to learn given scarce data.\n* [Zero-shot](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/zero-shot-learning): An LLM is prompted to complete a task without having seen any examples beforehand. This unveils a model’s ability to comprehend new concepts and adapt to novel scenarios.\n* Fine-tuned: A model is trained on a dataset akin to what the benchmark uses. The goal is to boost the LLM’s command of the task associated with the benchmark and optimize its performance in that specific task.\n\n### Scoring\n\nOnce tests are done, an LLM benchmark computes how close a model’s output resembles the expected solution or standard answer, then generates a score between 0 and 100.\n\nIndustry newsletter\n\n### The latest AI trends, brought to you by experts\n\nGet curated insights on the most important—and intriguing—AI news.

Refer to our [IBM Privacy Statement](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/privacy) for more information.\n\n## Key metrics for benchmarking LLMs\n\nBenchmarks apply different metrics to evaluate the performance of LLMs. Here are some common ones:\n\n* **Accuracy or precision** calculates the percentage of correct predictions.\n* **Recall**, also called the sensitivity rate, quantifies the number of true positives—the actual correct predictions.\n* The **F1 score** blends both accuracy and recall into one metric. It considers the two measures to be of equal weight to balance out any false positives or false negatives. F1 scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 signifying excellent recall and precision.\n* **Exact match** is the proportion of predictions an LLM matches exactly and is a valuable criteria for translation and question answering.\n* **Perplexity** measures how good a model is at prediction. The lower an LLM’s perplexity score, the better it is at comprehending a task.\n* **Bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU)** evaluates machine translation by computing the matching n-grams (a sequence of n-adjacent text symbols) between an LLM’s predicted translation and a human-produced translation.\n* **Recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE)** evaluates text summarization and has several types. ROUGE-N, for instance, does similar calculations as BLEU for summaries, while ROUGE-L computes the longest common subsequence between the predicted summary and the human-produced summary.\n\nOne or more of these quantitative metrics are usually combined for a more comprehensive and robust assessment.\n\nMeanwhile, human evaluation involves qualitative metrics such as coherence, relevance and semantic meaning. Human assessors examining and scoring an LLM can make for a more nuanced assessment, but it can be labor intensive, subjective and time consuming. Therefore, a balance of both quantitative and qualitative metrics is needed.\n\nAI Academy\n\n### Why foundation models are a paradigm shift for AI\n\nLearn about a new class of flexible, reusable AI models that can unlock new revenue, reduce costs and increase productivity, then use our guidebook to dive deeper.\n\n[Go to episode](https://www.ibm.com/think/videos/ai-academy/foundation-models-paradigm-shift)\n\n## Limitations of LLM benchmarks\n\nWhile benchmarks are solid indicators of LLM performance, they can’t predict how well a model will operate in the real world. Here are a few constraints of LLM benchmarks:\n\nBounded scoring\n\n\nOnce a model reaches the highest possible score for a certain benchmark, that benchmark will need to be updated with more difficult tasks to make it a useful measure.\n\nBroad dataset\n\n\nSince LLM benchmarks use sample data derived mostly from a broad range of subjects and a wide array of tasks, they may not be a fitting metric for edge scenarios, specialized areas or specific use cases.\n\nFinite assessments\n\n\nLLM benchmarks can only test a model’s current skills. But as LLMs advance and novel capabilities emerge, new benchmarks will have to be created.\n\nOverfitting\n\n\nIf an LLM is trained on the same dataset as the benchmark, it could lead to [overfitting](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/overfitting), wherein the model might perform well on the test data but not on real-world data. This results in a score that doesn’t reflect an LLM’s actual abilities.\n\n## What are LLM leaderboards?\n\nLLM leaderboards publish a ranking of LLMs based on a variety of benchmarks. Leaderboards provide a way to keep track of the myriad LLMs and compare their performance. LLM leaderboards are especially beneficial in making decisions on which models to use.\n\nEach benchmark typically has its own leaderboard, but independent LLM leaderboards also exist. For instance, Hugging Face has a collection of leaderboards, one of which is an open LLM leaderboard that ranks multiple open-source models based on the ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA and Winogrande benchmarks.\n\n## Common LLM benchmarks\n\nResearchers classify LLM benchmarks according to these two aspects:1\n\n* **Assessment criteria:**\xa0LLM evaluation metrics can either be ground truth or human preferences.\xa0**Ground truth**\xa0refers to information assumed to be true, while\xa0**human preferences**\xa0are choices reflecting real-world usage.\n* **Source of questions:**\xa0Prompts can come from either static or live sources. **Static** prompts contain predefined questions, while **live** prompts are questions made in an interactive environment.\n\nBenchmarks can fall into one or more of these categories. Here’s how some popular benchmarks work:\n\n### AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)\n\nARC measures an LLM’s question answering and reasoning abilities through a series of more than 7,000 grade-school natural science questions. These questions are divided into an easy set and a challenge set. Scoring is simple, with a model getting one point for each correct answer and 1/N points if it provides multiple answers and one of those is correct.2\n\n### Chatbot Arena\n\nChatbot Arena is an open benchmark platform that pits two anonymous chatbots against each other. Users have random real-world conversations with both chatbots in an “arena,” then cast votes on which one they prefer, after which the models’ identities are revealed. This crowdsourced pairwise comparison data is fed into statistical methods that estimate scores and create approximate rankings for various LLMs. Sampling algorithms are also used to pair models.1\n\n### Grade School Math 8K (GSM8K)\n\nGSM8K tests an LLM’s mathematical reasoning skills. It has a corpus of 8,500 grade-school math word problems. Solutions are collected in the form of natural language instead of mathematical expressions. AI verifiers are trained to evaluate model solutions.3\n\n### HellaSwag\n\nHellaSwag is an acronym for “Harder Endings, Longer contexts and Low-shot Activities for Situations With Adversarial Generations.” This benchmark is centered around commonsense reasoning and natural language inference. Models are tasked with completing sentences by choosing from a number of possible endings. These endings include wrong answers created through adversarial filtering, an algorithm that generates realistic yet deceptively incorrect answers. HellaSwag evaluates accuracy for both few-shot and zero-shot categories.4\n\n### HumanEval\n\nHumanEval assesses an LLM’s performance in terms of [code generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/code-generator), specifically functional correctness. Models are given programming problems to solve and are evaluated based on passing the corresponding unit tests. This is similar to human software developers who test if their code is correct based on passing particular unit tests. The HumanEval benchmark uses its own evaluation metric called pass@k, which is the probability that at least one of the k-generated code solutions for a coding problem passes that problem’s unit tests.5\n\n### Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)\n\nMMLU is a benchmark assessing the breadth of an LLM’s knowledge, the depth of its [natural language understanding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/nlp-vs-nlu-vs-nlg) and its ability to solve problems based on gained knowledge. MMLU’s dataset encompasses more than 15,000 multiple-choice general knowledge questions across 57 subjects. Evaluation occurs solely in few-shot and zero-shot settings. The MMLU benchmark scores a model’s accuracy in each subject then averages those numbers for a final score.6\n\n### Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP)\n\nMBPP, also known as Mostly Basic Python Problems, is another code generation benchmark. It has a corpus of more than 900 coding tasks. Akin to HumanEval, it assesses functional correctness based on passing a set of test cases. Evaluation happens in few-shot and fine-tuned settings. MBPP uses two metrics: the percentage of problems that are solved by any sample from the model and the percentage of samples solving their respective tasks.7\n\n### MT-Bench\n\nThe researchers behind Chatbot Arena also created MT-Bench, which is designed to test how well an LLM can engage in dialogue and follow instructions. Its dataset consists of open-ended multi-turn questions, with 10 questions each in these eight areas: coding, extraction, knowledge I (STEM), knowledge II (humanities and social sciences), math, reasoning, roleplay and writing. MT-Bench uses the GPT-4 LLM to evaluate the responses of other LLMs.8\n\n### SWE-bench\n\nLike HumanEval, SWE-bench tests an LLM’s [code generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-code-generation) skills, with a focus on issue resolution. Models are tasked with fixing a bug or addressing a feature request in a specific code base. The benchmark’s assessment metric is the percentage of resolved task instances.9\n\n### TruthfulQA\n\nLarge language models have a tendency to [hallucinate](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations), resulting in inaccurate outputs. The TruthfulQA benchmark aims to tackle this by measuring an LLM’s ability to generate truthful answers to questions. Its dataset contains more than 800 questions spanning 38 subjects. TruthfulQA combines human evaluation with the GPT-3 LLM fine-tuned on the BLEU and ROUGE metrics to predict human assessments of informativeness and truthfulness.10\n\n### Winogrande\n\nWinogrande evaluates an LLM’s commonsense reasoning capabilities. It builds upon the original Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) benchmark, with a huge dataset of 44,000 crowdsourced problems that also uses adversarial filtering. Scoring is based on accuracy.11\n\n[Ebook\n\nHow to choose the right foundation model\n\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\n\nRead the ebook](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52620)\n\n## Resources\n\n[AI models\n\nExplore IBM Granite\n\nDiscover IBM® Granite™, our family of open, performant and trusted AI models, tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

LLM benchmarks help **evaluate a large language model’s performance by providing a standardized procedure to measure metrics** around a variety of tasks.\n\n**Benchmarks contain all the setup and data** you need to evaluate LLMs for your purposes, including:\n\n* “Ground truth” datasets (relevant tasks/questions/prompts with expected answers)\n* How the input prompts should be fed into the LLM\n* How the output responses should be interpreted/collected\n* Which metrics and scores to compute (and how)\n\nTogether, these provide a consistent way to compare performance across models.

It’s an improved version of the standard [MMLU dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/mmlu).\n\nIn this benchmark, models have to **answer multiple-choice questions with 10 choices** (instead of the 4 in basic MMLU) with reasoning required for some questions. The dataset is of higher quality than MMLU, which was considered to have noisy data and data contamination (meaning lots of newer models are likely trained on the questions contained therein), reducing its difficulty for models and therefore, its usefulness. MMLU-PRO rectifies that and is considered **more challenging than MMLU**.

MathEval provides comprehensive evaluation across various difficulties and subfields of mathematics (arithmetic, primary and secondary school competition problems, and advanced subfields). Besides evaluation, MathEval also aims to guide developers in further improving the mathematical capabilities of models. You can extend it with new mathematical evaluation datasets as you see fit.\n\n### Security-related benchmarks\n\n#### [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT)\n\nPyRIT stands for Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT). It’s more of a framework than a standalone benchmark, but a useful tool developed by Microsoft.\n\nPyRIT is a tool to **evaluate LLM robustness** against a range of harm categories. It can be used to **identify harm categories** including fabricated/ungrounded content (for instance, hallucination), misuse (bias, malware generation, jailbreaking), prohibited content (such as harassment), and privacy harms (identity theft).

Bowman New York University Abstract In the last year, new models and methods for pretraining and transfer learning have driven striking performance improvements across a range of language understand-ing tasks. The GLUE benchmark, introduced a little over one year ago, offers a single-number metric that summarizes progress on a diverse set of such tasks, but performance on the benchmark has recently surpassed the level of non-expert humans, suggesting limited headroom for further research. In this paper we present SuperGLUE, a new benchmark styled after GLUE with a new set of more difﬁ-cult language understanding tasks, a software toolkit, and a public leaderboard.\nSuperGLUE is available at super.gluebenchmark.com.\n1 Introduction In the past year, there has been notable progress across many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, led by methods such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). The common thread connecting these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning from massive unlabelled text corpora with a recipe for effectively adapting the resulting model to target tasks. The tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, sentiment analysis, textual entailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev and Klein, 2018, i.a.).\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation framework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is a collection of nine language understanding tasks built on existing public datasets, together with private test data, an evaluation server, a single-number target metric, and an accompanying expert-constructed diagnostic set. GLUE was designed to provide a general-purpose evaluation of language understanding that covers a range of training data volumes, task genres, and task formulations. We believe it was these aspects that made GLUE particularly appropriate for exhibiting the transfer-learning potential of approaches like OpenAI GPT and BERT.\nThe progress of the last twelve months has eroded headroom on the GLUE benchmark dramatically.\nWhile some tasks (Figure 1) and some linguistic phenomena (Figure 2 in Appendix B) measured in GLUE remain difﬁcult, the current state of the art GLUE Score as of early July 2019 (88.4 from Yang et al., 2019) surpasses human performance (87.1 from Nangia and Bowman, 2019) by 1.3 ∗Equal contribution.

More information on the tasks included in GLUE can be found in Wang et al. (2019a) and in Warstadt et al. (2018, CoLA), Socher et al. (2013, SST-2), Dolan and Brockett (2005, MRPC), Cer et al.

Consequently, while there remains substantial scope for improvement towards GLUE’s high-level goals, the original version of the benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of language understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a simple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-gies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive innovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer, multitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around eight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number performance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways: • More challenging tasks: SuperGLUE retains the two hardest tasks in GLUE. The remain-ing tasks were identiﬁed from those submitted to an open call for task proposals and were selected based on difﬁculty for current NLP approaches.\n• More diverse task formats: The task formats in GLUE are limited to sentence- and sentence-pair classiﬁcation. We expand the set of task formats in SuperGLUE to include coreference resolution and question answering (QA).\n• Comprehensive human baselines: We include human performance estimates for all bench-mark tasks, which verify that substantial headroom exists between a strong BERT-based baseline and human performance.\n• Improved code support: SuperGLUE is distributed with a new, modular toolkit for work on pretraining, multi-task learning, and transfer learning in NLP, built around standard tools including PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) and AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017).\n• Reﬁned usage rules: The conditions for inclusion on the SuperGLUE leaderboard have been revamped to ensure fair competition, an informative leaderboard, and full credit assignment to data and task creators.\nThe SuperGLUE leaderboard, data, and software tools are available at super.gluebenchmark.com.\n2 2 Related Work Much work prior to GLUE demonstrated that training neural models with large amounts of available supervision can produce representations that effectively transfer to a broad range of NLP tasks (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Dai and Le, 2015; Kiros et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2016; Conneau and Kiela, 2018; McCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018). GLUE was presented as a formal challenge affording straightforward comparison between such task-agnostic transfer learning techniques. Other similarly-motivated benchmarks include SentEval (Conneau and Kiela, 2018), which speciﬁcally evaluates ﬁxed-size sentence embeddings, and DecaNLP (McCann et al., 2018), which recasts a set of target tasks into a general question-answering format and prohibits task-speciﬁc parameters. In contrast, GLUE provides a lightweight classiﬁcation API and no restrictions on model architecture or parameter sharing, which seems to have been well-suited to recent work in this area.\nSince its release, GLUE has been used as a testbed and showcase by the developers of several inﬂuential models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). As shown in Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking. On GLUE, GPT and BERT achieved scores of 72.8 and 80.2 respectively, relative to 66.5 for an ELMo-based model (Peters et al., 2018) and 63.7 for the strongest baseline with no multitask learning or pretraining above the word level. Recent models (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) have clearly surpassed estimates of non-expert human performance on GLUE (Nangia and Bowman, 2019). The success of these models on GLUE has been driven by ever-increasing model capacity, compute power, and data quantity, as well as innovations in model expressivity (from recurrent to bidirectional recurrent to multi-headed transformer encoders) and degree of contextualization (from learning representation of words in isolation to using uni-directional contexts and ultimately to leveraging bidirectional contexts).\nIn parallel to work scaling up pretrained models, several studies have focused on complementary methods for augmenting performance of pretrained models. Phang et al. (2018) show that BERT can be improved using two-stage pretraining, i.e., ﬁne-tuning the pretrained model on an intermediate data-rich supervised task before ﬁne-tuning it again on a data-poor target task. Liu et al. (2019d,c) and Bach et al. (2018) get further improvements respectively via multi-task ﬁnetuning and using massive amounts of weak supervision. Anonymous (2018) demonstrate that knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015; Furlanello et al., 2018) can lead to student networks that outperform their teachers.\nOverall, the quantity and quality of research contributions aimed at the challenges posed by GLUE underline the utility of this style of benchmark for machine learning researchers looking to evaluate new application-agnostic methods on language understanding.\nLimits to current approaches are also apparent via the GLUE suite. Performance on the GLUE diagnostic entailment dataset, at 0.42 R3, falls far below the average human performance of 0.80 R3 reported in the original GLUE publication, with models performing near, or even below, chance on some linguistic phenomena (Figure 2, Appendix B). While some initially difﬁcult categories saw gains from advances on GLUE (e.g., double negation), others remain hard (restrictivity) or even adversarial (disjunction, downward monotonicity). This suggests that even as unsupervised pretraining produces ever-better statistical summaries of text, it remains difﬁcult to extract many details crucial to semantics without the right kind of supervision. Much recent work has made similar observations about the limitations of existing pretrained models (Jia and Liang, 2017; Naik et al., 2018; McCoy and Linzen, 2019; McCoy et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019a,b).\n3 SuperGLUE Overview 3.1 Design Process The goal of SuperGLUE is to provide a simple, robust evaluation metric of any method capable of being applied to a broad range of language understanding tasks. To that end, in designing SuperGLUE, we identify the following desiderata of tasks in the benchmark: • Task substance: Tasks should test a system’s ability to understand and reason about texts written in English.\n• Task difﬁculty: Tasks should be beyond the scope of current state-of-the-art systems, but solvable by most college-educated English speakers. We exclude tasks that require domain-speciﬁc knowledge, e.g. medical notes or scientiﬁc papers.\n3 Table 1: The tasks included in SuperGLUE. WSD stands for word sense disambiguation, NLI is natural language inference, coref. is coreference resolution, and QA is question answering. For MultiRC, we list the number of total answers for 456/83/166 train/dev/test questions. The metrics for MultiRC are binary F1 on all answer-options and exact match.\nCorpus |Train| |Dev| |Test| Task Metrics Text Sources BoolQ 9427 3270 3245 QA acc.\nGoogle queries, Wikipedia CB 250 57 250 NLI acc./F1 various COPA 400 100 500 QA acc.\nblogs, photography encyclopedia MultiRC 5100 953 1800 QA F1a/EM various ReCoRD 101k 10k 10k QA F1/EM news (CNN, Daily Mail) RTE 2500 278 300 NLI acc.\nnews, Wikipedia WiC 6000 638 1400 WSD acc.\nWordNet, VerbNet, Wiktionary WSC 554 104 146 coref.\nacc.\nﬁction books • Evaluability: Tasks must have an automatic performance metric that corresponds well to human judgments of output quality. Certain text generation tasks fail to meet this criteria due to issues surrounding automatic metrics like ROUGE and BLEU (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2016, i.a.).\n• Public data: We require that tasks have existing public training data in order to minimize the risks involved in newly-created datasets. We also prefer tasks for which we have access to (or could create) a test set with private labels.\n• Task format: We prefer tasks that had relatively simple input and output formats, to avoid incentivizing the users of the benchmark to create complex task-speciﬁc model architectures.\nNevertheless, while GLUE is restricted to tasks involving single sentence or sentence pair inputs, for SuperGLUE we expand the scope to consider tasks with longer inputs. This yields a set of tasks that requires understanding individual tokens in context, complete sentences, inter-sentence relations, and entire paragraphs.\n• License: We require that task data be available under licences that allow use and redistribu-tion for research purposes.\nTo identify possible tasks for SuperGLUE, we disseminated a public call for task proposals to the NLP community, and received approximately 30 proposals. We ﬁltered these proposals according to our criteria. Many proposals were not suitable due to licensing issues, complex formats, and insufﬁcient headroom; we provide examples of such tasks in Appendix D. For each of the remaining tasks, we ran a BERT-based baseline and a human baseline, and ﬁltered out tasks which were either too challenging for humans without extensive training or too easy for our machine baselines.\n3.2 Selected Tasks Following this process, we arrived at eight tasks to use in SuperGLUE. See Tables 1 and 2 for details and speciﬁc examples of each task.\nBoolQ (Boolean Questions, Clark et al., 2019) is a QA task where each example consists of a short passage and a yes/no question about the passage. The questions are provided anonymously and unsolicited by users of the Google search engine, and afterwards paired with a paragraph from a Wikipedia article containing the answer. Following the original work, we evaluate with accuracy.\nCB (CommitmentBank, De Marneffe et al., 2019) is a corpus of short texts in which at least one sentence contains an embedded clause. Each of these embedded clauses is annotated with the degree to which it appears the person who wrote the text is committed to the truth of the clause. The resulting task framed as three-class textual entailment on examples that are drawn from the Wall Street Journal, ﬁction from the British National Corpus, and Switchboard. Each example consists of a premise containing an embedded clause and the corresponding hypothesis is the extraction of that clause.\nWe use a subset of the data that had inter-annotator agreement above 80%. The data is imbalanced (relatively fewer neutral examples), so we evaluate using accuracy and F1, where for multi-class F1 we compute the unweighted average of the F1 per class.\n4 Table 2: Development set examples from the tasks in SuperGLUE. Bold text represents part of the example format for each task. Text in italics is part of the model input. Underlined text is specially marked in the input. Text in a monospaced font represents the expected model output.\nBoolQ Passage: Barq’s – Barq’s is an American soft drink. Its brand of root beer is notable for having caffeine.\nBarq’s, created by Edward Barq and bottled since the turn of the 20th century, is owned by the Barq family but bottled by the Coca-Cola Company. It was known as Barq’s Famous Olde Tyme Root Beer until 2012.\nQuestion: is barq’s root beer a pepsi product Answer: No CB Text: B: And yet, uh, I we-, I hope to see employer based, you know, helping out. You know, child, uh, care centers at the place of employment and things like that, that will help out. A: Uh-huh. B: What do you think, do you think we are, setting a trend?\nHypothesis: they are setting a trend Entailment: Unknown COPA Premise: My body cast a shadow over the grass.\nQuestion: What’s the CAUSE for this?\nAlternative 1: The sun was rising.\nAlternative 2: The grass was cut.\nCorrect Alternative: 1 MultiRC Paragraph: Susan wanted to have a birthday party. She called all of her friends. She has ﬁve friends.\nHer mom said that Susan can invite them all to the party. Her ﬁrst friend could not go to the party because she was sick. Her second friend was going out of town. Her third friend was not so sure if her parents would let her. The fourth friend said maybe. The ﬁfth friend could go to the party for sure. Susan was a little sad. On the day of the party, all ﬁve friends showed up. Each friend had a present for Susan.\nSusan was happy and sent each friend a thank you card the next week Question: Did Susan’s sick friend recover? Candidate answers: Yes, she recovered (T), No (F), Yes (T), No, she didn’t recover (F), Yes, she was at Susan’s party (T) ReCoRD Paragraph: (CNN) Puerto Rico on Sunday overwhelmingly voted for statehood. But Congress, the only body that can approve new states, will ultimately decide whether the status of the US commonwealth changes. Ninety-seven percent of the votes in the nonbinding referendum favored statehood, an increase over the results of a 2012 referendum, ofﬁcial results from the State Electorcal Commission show. It was the ﬁfth such vote on statehood. "Today, we the people of Puerto Rico are sending a strong and clear message to the US Congress ... and to the world ... claiming our equal rights as American citizens, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said in a news release. @highlight Puerto Rico voted Sunday in favor of US statehood Query For one, they can truthfully say, “Don’t blame me, I didn’t vote for them, ” when discussing the <placeholder> presidency Correct Entities: US RTE Text: Dana Reeve, the widow of the actor Christopher Reeve, has died of lung cancer at age 44, according to the Christopher Reeve Foundation.\nHypothesis: Christopher Reeve had an accident.\nEntailment: False WiC Context 1: Room and board.\nContext 2: He nailed boards across the windows.\nSense match: False WSC Text: Mark told Pete many lies about himself, which Pete included in his book. He should have been more truthful.\nCoreference: False COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives, Roemmele et al., 2011) is a causal reasoning task in which a system is given a premise sentence and must determine either the cause or effect of the premise from two possible choices. All examples are handcrafted and focus on topics from blogs and a photography-related encyclopedia. Following the original work, we evaluate using accuracy.\nMultiRC (Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension, Khashabi et al., 2018) is a QA task where each example consists of a context paragraph, a question about that paragraph, and a list of possible answers. The system must predict which answers are true and which are false. While many QA tasks exist, we use MultiRC because of a number of desirable properties: (i) each question can have multiple possible correct answers, so each question-answer pair must be evaluated independent of other pairs, (ii) the questions are designed such that answering each question requires drawing facts from multiple context sentences, and (iii) the question-answer pair format more closely matches the API of other tasks in SuperGLUE than the more popular span-extractive QA format does. The paragraphs are drawn from seven domains including news, ﬁction, and historical text. The evaluation metrics are F1 over all answer-options (F1a) and exact match of each question’s set of answers (EM).\n5 ReCoRD (Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning Dataset, Zhang et al., 2018) is a multiple-choice QA task. Each example consists of a news article and a Cloze-style question about the article in which one entity is masked out. The system must predict the masked out entity from a given list of possible entities in the provided passage, where the same entity may be expressed using multiple different surface forms, all of which are considered correct. Articles are drawn from CNN and Daily Mail. Following the original work, we evaluate with max (over all mentions) token-level F1 and exact match (EM).\nRTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment) datasets come from a series of annual competitions on textual entailment.2 RTE is included in GLUE, and we use the same data and format as GLUE: We merge data from RTE1 (Dagan et al., 2006), RTE2 (Bar Haim et al., 2006), RTE3 (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), and RTE5 (Bentivogli et al., 2009).3 All datasets are combined and converted to two-class classiﬁcation: entailment and not_entailment. Of all the GLUE tasks, RTE is among those that beneﬁts from transfer learning the most, with performance jumping from near random-chance (∼56%) at the time of GLUE’s launch to 86.3% accuracy (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) at the time of writing.\nGiven the nearly eight point gap with respect to human performance, however, the task is not yet solved by machines, and we expect the remaining gap to be difﬁcult to close.\nWiC (Word-in-Context, Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) is a word sense disambiguation task cast as binary classiﬁcation of sentence pairs. Given two text snippets and a polysemous word that appears in both sentences, the task is to determine whether the word is used with the same sense in both sentences. Sentences are drawn from WordNet (Miller, 1995), VerbNet (Schuler, 2005), and Wiktionary. We follow the original work and evaluate using accuracy.\nWSC (Winograd Schema Challenge, Levesque et al., 2012) is a coreference resolution task in which examples consist of a sentence with a pronoun and a list of noun phrases from the sentence.\nThe system must determine the correct referrent of the pronoun from among the provided choices.\nWinograd schemas are designed to require everyday knowledge and commonsense reasoning to solve.\nGLUE includes a version of WSC recast as NLI, known as WNLI. Until very recently, no substantial progress had been made on WNLI, with many submissions opting to submit majority class predic-tions.4 In the past few months, several works (Kocijan et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019d) have made rapid progress via a hueristic data augmentation scheme, raising machine performance to 90.4% accuracy.\nGiven estimated human performance of ∼96%, there is still a gap between machine and human performance, which we expect will be relatively difﬁcult to close. We therefore include a version of WSC cast as binary classiﬁcation, where each example consists of a sentence with a marked pronoun and noun, and the task is to determine if the pronoun refers to that noun. The training and validation examples are drawn from the original WSC data (Levesque et al., 2012), as well as those distributed by the afﬁliated organization Commonsense Reasoning.5 The test examples are derived from ﬁction books and have been shared with us by the authors of the original dataset. We evaluate using accuracy.\n3.3 Scoring As with GLUE, we seek to give a sense of aggregate system performance over all tasks by averaging scores of all tasks. Lacking a fair criterion with which to weight the contributions of each task to the overall score, we opt for the simple approach of weighing each task equally, and for tasks with multiple metrics, ﬁrst averaging those metrics to get a task score.\n3.4 Tools for Model Analysis Analyzing Linguistic and World Knowledge in Models GLUE includes an expert-constructed, diagnostic dataset that automatically tests models for a broad range of linguistic, commonsense, and world knowledge. Each example in this broad-coverage diagnostic is a sentence pair labeled with 2Textual entailment is also known as natural language inference, or NLI 3RTE4 is not publicly available, while RTE6 and RTE7 do not conform to the standard NLI task.\n4WNLI is especially difﬁcult due to an adversarial train/dev split: Premise sentences that appear in the training set often appear in the development set with a different hypothesis and a ﬂipped label. If a system memorizes the training set, which was easy due to the small size of the training set, it could perform far below chance on the development set. We remove this adversarial design in our version of WSC by ensuring that no sentences are shared between the training, validation, and test sets.\n5http://commonsensereasoning.org/disambiguation.html 6 a three-way entailment relation (entailment, neutral, or contradiction) and tagged with labels that indicate the phenomena that characterize the relationship between the two sentences. Submissions to the GLUE leaderboard are required to include predictions from the submission’s MultiNLI classiﬁer on the diagnostic dataset, and analyses of the results were shown alongside the main leaderboard. Since this broad-coverage diagnostic task has proved difﬁcult for top models, we retain it in SuperGLUE. However, since MultiNLI is not part of SuperGLUE, we collapse contradiction and neutral into a single not_entailment label, and request that submissions include predictions on the resulting set from the model used for the RTE task. We collect non-expert annotations to estimate human performance, following the same procedure we use for the main benchmark tasks (Section 5.2). We estimate an accuracy of 88% and a Matthew’s correlation coefﬁcient (MCC, the two-class variant of the R3 metric used in GLUE) of 0.77.\nAnalyzing Gender Bias in Models Recent work has identiﬁed the presence and ampliﬁcation of many social biases in data-driven machine learning models. (Lu et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2018). To promote the detection of such biases, we include Winogender (Rudinger et al., 2018) as an additional diagnostic dataset. Winogender is designed to measure gender bias in coreference resolution systems. We use the Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection (DNC; Poliak et al., 2018) version that casts Winogender as a textual entailment task.6 Each example consists of a premise sentence with a male or female pronoun and a hypothesis giving a possible antecedent of the pronoun. Examples occur in minimal pairs, where the only difference between an example and its pair is the gender of the pronoun in the premise. Performance on Winogender is measured with both accuracy and the gender parity score: the percentage of minimal pairs for which the predictions are the same. We note that a system can trivially obtain a perfect gender parity score by guessing the same class for all examples, so a high gender parity score is meaningless unless accompanied by high accuracy. We collect non-expert annotations to estimate human performance, and observe an accuracy of 99.7% and a gender parity score of 0.99.\nLike any diagnostic, Winogender has limitations. It offers only positive predictive value: A poor bias score is clear evidence that a model exhibits gender bias, but a good score does not mean that the model is unbiased. More speciﬁcally, in the DNC version of the task, a low gender parity score means that a model’s prediction of textual entailment can be changed with a change in pronouns, all else equal. It is plausible that there are forms of bias that are relevant to target tasks of interest, but that do not surface in this setting (Gonen and Goldberg, 2019). In addition, Winogender does not cover all forms of social bias, or even all forms of gender. For instance, the version of the data used here offers no coverage of gender-neutral they or non-binary pronouns. Despite these limitations, we believe that Winogender’s inclusion is worthwhile in providing a coarse sense of how social biases evolve with model performance and for keeping attention on the social ramiﬁcations of NLP models.\n4 Using SuperGLUE Software Tools To facilitate using SuperGLUE, we release jiant (Wang et al., 2019b),7 a modular software toolkit, built with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017), components from AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017), and the pytorch-pretrained-bert package.8 jiant implements our baselines and supports the evaluation of custom models and training methods on the benchmark tasks. The toolkit includes support for existing popular pretrained models such as OpenAI GPT and BERT, as well as support for multistage and multitask learning of the kind seen in the strongest models on GLUE.\nEligibility Any system or method that can produce predictions for the SuperGLUE tasks is eligible for submission to the leaderboard, subject to the data-use and submission frequency policies stated immediately below. There are no restrictions on the type of methods that may be used, and there is no requirement that any form of parameter sharing or shared initialization be used across the tasks in the benchmark. To limit overﬁtting to the private test data, users are limited to a maximum of two submissions per day and six submissions per month.\n6We ﬁlter out 23 examples where the labels are ambiguous 7https://github.com/nyu-mll/jiant 8https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT 7 Table 3: Baseline performance on the SuperGLUE test sets and diagnostics. For CB we report accuracy and macro-average F1. For MultiRC we report F1 on all answer-options and exact match of each question’s set of correct answers. AXb is the broad-coverage diagnostic task, scored using Matthews’ correlation (MCC). AXg is the Winogender diagnostic, scored using accuracy and the gender parity score (GPS). All values are scaled by 100. The Avg column is the overall benchmark score on non-AX∗tasks. The bolded numbers reﬂect the best machine performance on task. *MultiRC has multiple test sets released on a staggered schedule, and these results evaluate on an installation of the test set that is a subset of ours.\nModel Avg BoolQ CB COPA MultiRC ReCoRD RTE WiC WSC AXb AXg Metrics Acc.\nF1/Acc.\nAcc.\nF1a/EM F1/EM Acc.

Each task comes with a standardized training set, development set, and unlabeled test set. Submitted systems may use any public or private data when developing their systems, with a few exceptions: Systems may only use the SuperGLUE-distributed versions of the task datasets, as these use different train/validation/test splits from other public versions in some cases. Systems also may not use the unlabeled test data for the tasks in system development in any way, may not use the structured source data that was used to collect the WiC labels (sense-annotated example sentences from WordNet, VerbNet, and Wiktionary) in any way, and may not build systems that share information across separate test examples in any way.\nWe do not endorse the use of the benchmark data for non-research applications, due to concerns about socially relevant biases (such as ethnicity–occupation associations) that may be undesirable or legally problematic in deployed systems. Because these biases are evident in texts from a wide variety of sources and collection methods (e.g., Rudinger et al., 2017), and because none of our task datasets directly mitigate them, one can reasonably presume that our training sets teach models these biases to some extent and that our evaluation sets similarly reward models that learn these biases.\nTo ensure reasonable credit assignment, because we build very directly on prior work, we ask the authors of submitted systems to directly name and cite the speciﬁc datasets that they use, including the benchmark datasets. We will enforce this as a requirement for papers to be listed on the leaderboard.\n5 Experiments 5.1 Baselines BERT Our main baselines are built around BERT, variants of which are among the most successful approach on GLUE at the time of writing. Speciﬁcally, we use the bert-large-cased variant.\nFollowing the practice recommended in Devlin et al. (2019), for each task, we use the simplest possible architecture on top of BERT. We ﬁne-tune a copy of the pretrained BERT model separately for each task, and leave the development of multi-task learning models to future work. For training, we use the procedure speciﬁed in Devlin et al. (2019): We use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with an initial learning rate of 10−5 and ﬁne-tune for a maximum of 10 epochs.\nFor classiﬁcation tasks with sentence-pair inputs (BoolQ, CB, RTE, WiC), we concatenate the sentences with a [SEP] token, feed the fused input to BERT, and use a logistic regression classiﬁer that sees the representation corresponding to [CLS]. For WiC only, we also concatenate the representation of the marked word to the [CLS] representation. For COPA, MultiRC, and ReCoRD, for each answer choice, we similarly concatenate the context with that answer choice and feed the resulting sequence into BERT to produce an answer representation. For COPA, we project these representations into a scalar, and take as the answer the choice with the highest associated scalar. For MultiRC, because each question can have more than one correct answer, we feed each answer representation into 8 a logistic regression classiﬁer. For ReCoRD, we also evaluate the probability of each candidate independent of other candidates, and take the most likely candidate as the model’s prediction. For WSC, which is a span-based task, we use a model inspired by Tenney et al. (2019). Given the BERT representation for each word in the original sentence, we get span representations of the pronoun and noun phrase via a self-attention span-pooling operator (Lee et al., 2017), before feeding it into a logistic regression classiﬁer.\nBERT++ We also report results using BERT with additional training on related datasets before ﬁne-tuning on the benchmark tasks, following the STILTs two-stage style of transfer learning (Phang et al., 2018). Given the productive use of MultiNLI in pretraining and intermediate ﬁne-tuning of pretrained language models (Conneau et al., 2017; Phang et al., 2018, i.a.), for CB, RTE, and BoolQ, we use MultiNLI as a transfer task by ﬁrst using the above procedure on MultiNLI. Similarly, given the similarity of COPA to SWAG (Zellers et al., 2018), we ﬁrst ﬁne-tune BERT on SWAG. These results are reported as BERT++. For all other tasks, we reuse the results of BERT ﬁne-tuned on just that task.\nSimple Baselines We include a baseline where for each task we simply predict the majority class,9 as well as a bag-of-words baseline where each input is represented as an average of its tokens’ GloVe word vectors (the 300D/840B release from Pennington et al., 2014).\nOutside Best We list the best known result on each task to date, except on tasks which we recast (WSC), resplit (CB), or achieve the best known result (WiC). The outside results for COPA, MultiRC, and RTE are from Sap et al. (2019), Trivedi et al. (2019), and Liu et al. (2019d) respectively.\n5.2 Human Performance Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados (2019), Khashabi et al. (2018), Nangia and Bowman (2019), and Zhang et al. (2018) respectively provide estimates for human performance on WiC, MultiRC, RTE, and ReCoRD. For the remaining tasks, including the diagnostic set, we estimate human performance by hiring crowdworker annotators through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform to reannotate a sample of each test set. We follow a two step procedure where a crowd worker completes a short training phase before proceeding to the annotation phase, modeled after the method used by Nangia and Bowman (2019) for GLUE. For both phases and all tasks, the average pay rate is $23.75/hr.10 In the training phase, workers are provided with instructions on the task, linked to an FAQ page, and are asked to annotate up to 30 examples from the development set. After answering each example, workers are also asked to check their work against the provided ground truth label. After the training phase is complete, we provide the qualiﬁcation to work on the annotation phase to all workers who annotated a minimum of ﬁve examples, i.e. completed ﬁve HITs during training and achieved performance at, or above the median performance across all workers during training.\nIn the annotation phase, workers are provided with the same instructions as the training phase, and are linked to the same FAQ page. The instructions for all tasks are provided in Appendix C. For the annotation phase we randomly sample 100 examples from the task’s test set, with the exception of WSC where we annotate the full test set. For each example, we collect annotations from ﬁve workers and take a majority vote to estimate human performance. For additional details, see Appendix C.3.\n5.3 Results Table 3 shows results for all baselines. The simple baselines of predicting the most frequent class and CBOW do not perform well overall, achieving near chance performance for several of the tasks.\nUsing BERT increases the average SuperGLUE score by 25 points, attaining signiﬁcant gains on all of the benchmark tasks, particularly MultiRC, ReCoRD, and RTE. On WSC, BERT actually performs worse than the simple baselines, likely due to the small size of the dataset and the lack of data augmentation. Using MultiNLI as an additional source of supervision for BoolQ, CB, and RTE leads to a 2-5 point improvement on all tasks. Using SWAG as a transfer task for COPA sees an 8 point improvement.\n9For ReCoRD, we predict the entity that has the highest F1 with the other entity options.\n10This estimate is taken from https://turkerview.com.\n9 Our best baselines still lag substantially behind human performance. On average, there is a nearly 20 point gap between BERT++ and human performance. The largest gap is on WSC, with a 35 point difference between the best model and human performance. The smallest margins are on BoolQ, CB, RTE, and WiC, with gaps of around 10 points on each of these. We believe these gaps will be challenging to close: On WSC and COPA, human performance is perfect. On three other tasks, it is in the mid-to-high 90s. On the diagnostics, all models continue to lag signiﬁcantly behind humans.\nThough all models obtain near perfect gender parity scores on Winogender, this is due to the fact that they are obtaining accuracy near that of random guessing.\n6 Conclusion We present SuperGLUE, a new benchmark for evaluating general-purpose language understanding systems. SuperGLUE updates the GLUE benchmark by identifying a new set of challenging NLU tasks, as measured by the difference between human and machine baselines. The set of eight tasks in our benchmark emphasizes diverse task formats and low-data training data tasks, with nearly half the tasks having fewer than 1k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10k examples.\nWe evaluate BERT-based baselines and ﬁnd that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points.\nGiven the difﬁculty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer, and unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level per-formance on the benchmark. Overall, we argue that SuperGLUE offers a rich and challenging testbed for work developing new general-purpose machine learning methods for language understanding.\n7 Acknowledgments We thank the original authors of the included datasets in SuperGLUE for their cooperation in the creation of the benchmark, as well as those who proposed tasks and datasets that we ultimately could not include.\nThis work was made possible in part by a donation to NYU from Eric and Wendy Schmidt made by recommendation of the Schmidt Futures program.

(2019a, see paper for a description of the categories).\nSome initially difﬁcult categories, like double negation, saw gains from advances on GLUE, but others remain hard (restrictivity) or even adversarial (disjunction, downward monotone).\nC Instructions to Crowd Workers C.1 Training Phase Instructions For collecting data to establish human performance on the SuperGLUE tasks, we follow a two step procedure where we ﬁrst provide some training to the crowd workers before they proceed to annotation. In the training step, we provide workers with brief instructions about the training phase.\nAn example of these instructions is given Table 5. These training instructions are the same across tasks, only the task name in the instructions is changed.\n17 C.2 Task Instructions During training and annotation for each task, we provide workers with brief instructions tailored to the task. We also link workers to an FAQ page for the task. Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9, show the instructions we used for all four tasks: COPA, CommitmentBank, WSC, and BoolQ respectively. The instructions given to crowd workers for annotations on the diagnostic and bias diagnostic datasets are shown in Table 11.\nWe collected data to produce conservative estimates for human performance on several tasks that we did not ultimately include in our benchmark, including GAP (Webster et al., 2018), PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019), Quora Insincere Questions,11 Ultraﬁne Entity Typing (Choi et al., 2018b), and Empathetic Reactions datasets (Buechel et al., 2018). The instructions we used for these tasks are shown in Tables 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.\nC.3 Task Speciﬁc Details For WSC and COPA we provide annotators with a two way classiﬁcation problem. We then use majority vote across annotations to calculate human performance.\nCommitmentBank We follow the authors in providing annotators with a 7-way classiﬁcation problem. We then collapse the annotations into 3 classes by using the same ranges for bucketing used by De Marneffe et al. (2019). We then use majority vote to get human performance numbers on the task.\nFurthermore, for training on CommitmentBank we randomly sample examples from the low inter-annotator agreement portion of the CommitmentBank data that is not included in the benchmark version of the task. These low agreement examples are generally harder to classify since they are more ambiguous.\nDiagnostic Dataset Since the diagnostic dataset does not come with accompanying training data, we train our workers on examples from RTE’s development set. RTE is also a textual entailment task and is the most closely related task in the main benchmark. Providing the crowd workers with training on RTE enables them to learn label deﬁnitions which should generalize to the diagnostic dataset.\nUltraﬁne Entity Typing We cast the task into a binary classiﬁcation problem to make it an easier task for non-expert crowd workers. We work in cooperation with the authors of the dataset (Choi et al., 2018b) to do this reformulation: We give workers one possible tag for a word or phrase and asked them to classify the tag as being applicable or not.\nThe authors used WordNet (Miller, 1995) to expand the set of labels to include synonyms and hypernyms from WordNet. They then asked ﬁve annotators to validate these tags. The tags from this validation had high agreement, and were included in the publicly available Ultraﬁne Entity Typing dataset,12 This constitutes our set of positive examples. The rest of the tags from the validation procedure that are not in the public dataset constitute our negative examples.\nGAP For the Gendered Ambiguous Pronoun Coreference task (GAP, Webster et al., 2018), we simpliﬁed the task by providing noun phrase spans as part of the input, thus reducing the original structure prediction task to a classiﬁcation task. This task was presented to crowd workers as a three way classiﬁcation problem: Choose span A, B, or neither.\nD Excluded Tasks In this section we provide some examples of tasks that we evaluated for inclusion but ultimately could not include. We report on these excluded tasks only with the permission of their authors. We turned down many medical text datasets because they are usually only accessible with explicit permission and credentials from the data owners.\n11https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data 12https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~eunsol/open_entity.html 18 Tasks like QuAC (Choi et al., 2018a) and STREUSLE (Schneider and Smith, 2015) differed substan-tially from the format of other tasks in our benchmark, which we worried would incentivize users to spend signiﬁcant effort on task-speciﬁc model designs, rather than focusing on general-purpose techniques. It was challenging to train annotators to do well on Quora Insincere Questions 13, Empa-thetic Reactions (Buechel et al., 2018), and a recast version of Ultra-Fine Entity Typing (Choi et al., 2018b, see Appendix C.3 for details), leading to low human performance. BERT achieved very high or superhuman performance on Query Well-Formedness (Faruqui and Das, 2018), PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019), Discovering Ongoing Conversations (Zanzotto and Ferrone, 2017), and GAP (Webster et al., 2018).\nDuring the process of selecting tasks for our benchmark, we collected human performance baselines and run BERT-based machine baselines for some tasks that we ultimately excluded from our task list. We chose to exclude these tasks because our BERT baseline performs better than our human performance baseline or if the gap between human and machine performance is small.\nOn Quora Insincere Questions our BERT baseline outperforms our human baseline by a small margin: an F1 score of 67.2 versus 66.7 for BERT and human baselines respectively. Similarly, on the Empathetic Reactions dataset, BERT outperforms our human baseline, where BERT’s predictions have a Pearson correlation of 0.45 on empathy and 0.55 on distress, compared to 0.45 and 0.35 for our human baseline. For PAWS-Wiki, we report that BERT achieves an accuracy of 91.9%, while our human baseline achieved 84% accuracy. These three tasks are excluded from the benchmark since our, admittedly conservative, human baselines are worse than machine performance. Our human performance baselines are subject to the clarity of our instructions (all instructions can be found in Appendix C), and crowd workers engagement and ability.\nFor the Query Well-Formedness task, the authors set an estimate human performance at 88.4% accuracy. Our BERT baseline model reaches an accuracy of 82.3%. While there is a positive gap on this task, the gap was smaller than we were were willing to tolerate. Similarly, on our recast version of the Ultraﬁne Entity Typing, we observe too small a gap between human (60.2 F1) and machine performance (55.0 F1). Our recasting for this task is described in Appendix C.2. On GAP, when taken as a classiﬁcation problem without the related task of span selection (details in C.2), BERT performs (91.0 F1) comparably to our human baseline (94.9 F1). Given this small margin, we also exclude GAP.\nOn Discovering Ongoing Conversations, our BERT baseline achieves an F1 of 51.9 on a version of the task cast as sentence pair classiﬁcation (given two snippets of texts from plays, determine if the second snippet is a continuation of the ﬁrst). This dataset is very class imbalanced (90% negative), so we also experimented with a class-balanced version on which our BERT baselines achieves 88.4 F1. Qualitatively, we also found the task challenging for humans as there was little context for the text snippets and the examples were drawn from plays using early English. Given this fairly high machine performance and challenging nature for humans, we exclude this task from our benchmark.\nInstructions tables begin on the following page.\n13https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data 19 Table 5: The instructions given to crowd-sourced worker describing the training phase for the Choice of Plausible Answers (COPA) task.\nThe New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English.

The Check Work button will reveal the true label. Please use this training and the provided answers to build an understanding of what the answers to these questions look like (the main project, Human Performance: Plausible Answer, does not have the answers on the page).\nTable 6: Task-speciﬁc instructions for Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA). These instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nPlausible Answer Instructions The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\nWe will present you with a prompt sentence and a question. The question will either be about what caused the situation described in the prompt, or what a possible effect of that situation is.\nWe will also give you two possible answers to this question. Your job is to decide, given the situation described in the prompt, which of the two options is a more plausible answer to the question: In the following example, option 1. is a more plausible answer to the question about what caused the situation described in the prompt, The girl received a trophy.\nWhat’s the CAUSE for this?\n1. She won a spelling bee.\n2. She made a new friend.\nIn the following example, option 2. is a more plausible answer the question about what happened because of the situation described in the prompt, The police aimed their weapons at the fugitive.\nWhat happened as a RESULT?\n1. The fugitive fell to the ground.\n2. The fugitive dropped his gun.\nIf you have any more questions, please refer to our FAQ page.\n20 Table 7: Task-speciﬁc instructions for Commitment Bank. These instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nSpeaker Commitment Instructions The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\nWe will present you with a prompt taken from a piece of dialogue, this could be a single sentence, a few sentences, or a short exchange between people. Your job is to ﬁgure out, based on this ﬁrst prompt (on top), how certain the speaker is about the truthfulness of the second prompt (on the bottom). You can choose from a 7 point scale ranging from (1) completely certain that the second prompt is true to (7) completely certain that the second prompt is false. Here are examples for a few of the labels: Choose 1 (certain that it is true) if the speaker from the ﬁrst prompt deﬁnitely believes or knows that the second prompt is true. For example, "What fun to hear Artemis laugh. She’s such a serious child. I didn’t know she had a sense of humor." "Artemis had a sense of humor" Choose 4 (not certain if it is true or false) if the speaker from the ﬁrst prompt is uncertain if the second prompt is true or false. For example, "Tess is committed to track. She’s always trained with all her heart and soul.\nOne can only hope that she has recovered from the ﬂu and will cross the ﬁnish line." "Tess crossed the ﬁnish line." Choose 7 (certain that it is false) if the speaker from the ﬁrst prompt deﬁnitely believes or knows that the second prompt is false. For example, "Did you hear about Olivia’s chemistry test? She studied really hard. But even after putting in all that time and energy, she didn’t manage to pass the test".\n"Olivia passed the test." If you have any more questions, please refer to our FAQ page.\n21 Table 8: Task-speciﬁc instructions for Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC). These instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nWinograd Schema Instructions The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\nWe will present you with a sentence that someone wrote, with one bolded pronoun. We will then ask if you if the pronoun refers to a speciﬁc word or phrase in the sentence. Your job is to ﬁgure out, based on the sentence, if the bolded pronoun refers to this selected word or phrase: Choose Yes if the pronoun refers to the selected word or phrase. For example, "I put the cake away in the refrigerator. It has a lot of butter in it." Does It in "It has a lot" refer to cake?\nChoose No if the pronoun does not refer to the selected word or phrase. For example, "The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of styrofoam." Does it in "it was made" refer to ball?\nIf you have any more questions, please refer to our FAQ page.\n22 Table 9: Task-speciﬁc instructions for BoolQ (continued in Table 10). These instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nQuestion-Answering Instructions The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\nWe will present you with a passage taken from a Wikipedia article and a relevant question. Your job is to decide, given the information provided in the passage, if the answer to the question is Yes or No. For example, In the following examples the correct answer is Yes, The thirteenth season of Criminal Minds was ordered on April 7, 2017, by CBS with an order of 22 episodes. The season premiered on September 27, 2017 in a new time slot at 10:00PM on Wednesday when it had previously been at 9:00PM on Wednesday since its inception. The season concluded on April 18, 2018 with a two-part season ﬁnale.\nwill there be a 13th season of criminal minds?\n(In the above example, the ﬁrst line of the passage says that the 13th season of the show was ordered.) As of 8 August 2016, the FDA extended its regulatory power to include e-cigarettes. Under this ruling the FDA will evaluate certain issues, including ingredients, product features and health risks, as well their appeal to minors and non-users. The FDA rule also bans access to minors. A photo ID is required to buy e-cigarettes, and their sale in all-ages vending machines is not permitted. The FDA in September 2016 has sent warning letters for unlawful underage sales to online retailers and retailers of e-cigarettes.\nis vaping illegal if you are under 18?\n(In the above example, the passage states that the "FDA rule also bans access to minors." The question uses the word "vaping," which is a synonym for e-cigrattes.) In the following examples the correct answer is No, Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also includes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.\nis a wolverine the same as a badger?\n(In the above example, the passage says that badgers and wolverines are in the same family, Mustelidae, which does not mean they are the same animal.) 23 Table 10: Continuation from Table 9 of task-speciﬁc instructions for BoolQ. These instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nMore famously, Harley-Davidson attempted to register as a trademark the distinctive “chug” of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine. On February 1, 1994, the company ﬁled its application with the following description: “The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant’s motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use.” Nine of Harley-Davidson’s competitors ﬁled oppositions against the applica-tion, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands use the same crankpin V-twin engine which produces the same sound. After six years of litigation, with no end in sight, in early 2000, Harley-Davidson withdrew their application.\ndoes harley davidson have a patent on their sound?\n(In the above example, the passage states that Harley-Davidson applied for a patent but then withdrew, so they do not have a patent on the sound.) If you have any more questions, please refer to our FAQ page.\n24 Table 11: Task-speciﬁc instructions for the diagnostic and the bias diagnostic datasets. These instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nTextual Entailment Instructions The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\nWe will present you with a prompt taken from an article someone wrote. Your job is to ﬁgure out, based on this correct prompt (the ﬁrst prompt, on top), if another prompt (the second prompt, on bottom) is also necessarily true: Choose True if the event or situation described by the ﬁrst prompt deﬁnitely implies that the second prompt, on bottom, must also be true. For example, • "Murphy recently decided to move to London." "Murphy recently decided to move to England." (The above example is True because London is in England and therefore prompt 2 is clearly implied by prompt 1.) • "Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov set the record for the longest continuous amount of time spent in space, a staggering 438 days, between 1994 and 1995." "Russians hold record for longest stay in space." (The above example is True because the information in the second prompt is contained in the ﬁrst prompt: Valery is Russian and she set the record for longest stay in space.) • "She does not disgree with her brother’s opinion, but she believes he’s too aggresive in his defense" "She agrees with her brother’s opinion, but she believes he’s too aggresive in his defense" (The above example is True because the second prompt is an exact paraphrase of the ﬁrst prompt, with exactly the same meaning.) Choose False if the event or situation described with the ﬁrst prompt on top does not necessarily imply that this second prompt must also be true. For example, • "This method was developed at Columbia and applied to data processing at CERN." "This method was developed at Columbia and applied to data processing at CERN with limited success." (The above example is False because the second prompt is introducing new information not implied in the ﬁrst prompt: The ﬁrst prompt does not give us any knowledge of how succesful the application of the method at CERN was.) • "This building is very tall." "This is the tallest building in New York." (The above example is False because a building being tall does not mean it must be the tallest building, nor that it is in New York.) • "Hours earlier, Yasser Arafat called for an end to attacks against Israeli civilians in the two weeks before Israeli elections." "Arafat condemned suicide bomb attacks inside Israel." (The above example is False because from the ﬁrst prompt we only know that Arafat called for an end to attacks against Israeli citizens, we do not know what kind of attacks he may have been condemning.) You do not have to worry about whether the writing style is maintained between the two prompts.\nIf you have any more questions, please refer to our FAQ page.\n25 Table 12: Task-speciﬁc instructions for the Gendered Ambiguous Pronoun Coreference (GAP) task.\nThese instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nGAP Instructions The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\nWe will present you with an extract from a Wikipedia article, with one bolded pronoun. We will also give you two names from the text that this pronoun could refer to. Your job is to ﬁgure out, based on the extract, if the pronoun refers to option A, options B, or neither: Choose A if the pronoun refers to option A. For example, "In 2010 Ella Kabambe was not the ofﬁcial Miss Malawi; this was Faith Chibale, but Kabambe represented the country in the Miss World pageant.\nAt the 2012 Miss World, Susan Mtegha pushed Miss New Zealand, Collette Lochore, during the opening headshot of the pageant, claiming that Miss New Zealand was in her space." Does her refer to option A or B below?\nA Susan Mtegha B Collette Lochore C Neither Choose B if the pronoun refers to option B. For example, "In 1650 he started his career as advisor in the ministerium of ﬁnances in Den Haag. After he became a minister he went back to Amsterdam, and took place as a sort of chairing mayor of this city. After the death of his brother Cornelis, De Graeff became the strong leader of the republicans. He held this position until the rampjaar." Does He refer to option A or B below?\nA Cornelis B De Graeff C Neither Choose C if the pronoun refers to neither option. For example, "Reb Chaim Yaakov’s wife is the sister of Rabbi Moishe Sternbuch, as is the wife of Rabbi Meshulam Dovid Soloveitchik, making the two Rabbis his uncles. Reb Asher’s brother Rabbi Shlomo Arieli is the author of a critical edition of the novallae of Rabbi Akiva Eiger. Before his marriage, Rabbi Arieli studied in the Ponevezh Yeshiva headed by Rabbi Shmuel Rozovsky, and he later studied under his father-in-law in the Mirrer Yeshiva." Does his refer to option A or B below?\nA Reb Asher B Akiva Eiger C Neither If you have any more questions, please refer to our FAQ page.\n26 Table 13: Task-speciﬁc instructions for the Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling (PAWS) task. These instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nParaphrase Detection Instructions The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\nWe will present you with two similar sentences taken from Wikipedia articles. Your job is to ﬁgure out if these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, and convey exactly the same meaning: Choose Yes if the sentences are paraphrases and have the exact same meaning. For example, "Hastings Ndlovu was buried with Hector Pieterson at Avalon Cemetery in Johannesburg." "Hastings Ndlovu , together with Hector Pieterson , was buried at the Avalon cemetery in Johannesburg ." "The complex of the Trabzon World Trade Center is close to Trabzon Airport ." "The complex of World Trade Center Trabzon is situated close to Trabzon Airport ." Choose No if the two sentences are not exact paraphrases and mean different things. For example, "She was only a few months in French service when she met some British frigates in 1809 ." "She was only in British service for a few months , when in 1809 , she encountered some French frigates ." "This work caused him to trigger important reﬂections on the practices of molecular genetics and genomics at a time when this was not considered ethical ." "This work led him to trigger ethical reﬂections on the practices of molecular genetics and genomics at a time when this was not considered important ."

These instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nInsincere Questions Instructions The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\nWe will present you with a question that someone posted on Quora. Your job is to ﬁgure out whether or not this is a sincere question. An insincere question is deﬁned as a question intended to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers. Some characteristics that can signify that a question is insincere: • Has a non-neutral tone – Has an exaggerated tone to underscore a point about a group of people – Is rhetorical and meant to imply a statement about a group of people • Is disparaging or inﬂammatory – Suggests a discriminatory idea against a protected class of people, or seeks conﬁrmation of a stereotype – Makes disparaging attacks/insults against a speciﬁc person or group of people – Based on an outlandish premise about a group of people – Disparages against a characteristic that is not ﬁxable and not measurable • Isn’t grounded in reality – Based on false information, or contains absurd assumptions – Uses sexual content (incest, bestiality, pedophilia) for shock value, and not to seek genuine answers Please note that there are far fewer insincere questions than there are sincere questions! So you should expect to label most questions as sincere.\nExamples, Choose Sincere if you believe the person asking the question was genuinely seeking an answer from the forum. For example, "How do DNA and RNA compare and contrast?" "Are there any sports that you don’t like?" "What is the main purpose of penance?" Choose Insincere if you believe the person asking the question was not really seeking an answer but was being inﬂammatory, extremely rhetorical, or absurd. For example, "How do I sell Pakistan? I need lots of money so I decided to sell Pakistan any one wanna buy?" "If Hispanics are so proud of their countries, why do they move out?" "Why Chinese people are always not welcome in all countries?"

Your job is to decide, in the context of the sentence, if this tag is correct and applicable to the bolded word or phrase: Choose Yes if the tag is applicable and accurately describes the selected word or phrase. For example, “Spain was the gold line." It started out with zero gold in 1937, and by 1945 it had 65.5 tons.\nTag: nation Choose No if the tag is not applicable and does not describes the selected word or phrase. For example, Iraqi museum workers are starting to assess the damage to Iraq’s history.\nTag: organism If you have any more questions, please refer to our FAQ page.\n29 Table 16: Task-speciﬁc instructions for the Empathetic Reaction task. These instructions were provided during both training and annotation phases.\nEmpathy and Distress Analysis Instructions The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!\nWe will present you with a message someone wrote after reading an article. Your job is to ﬁgure out, based on this message, how disressed and empathetic the author was feeling. Empathy is deﬁned as feeling warm, tender, sympathetic, moved, or compassionate. Distressed is deﬁned as feeling worried, upset, troubled, perturbed, grieved, distrubed, or alarmed.\nExamples, The author of the following message was not feeling empathetic at all with an empathy score of 1, and was very distressed with a distress score of 7, "I really hate ISIS. They continue to be the stain on society by committing atrocities condemned by every nation in the world. They must be stopped at all costs and they must be destroyed so that they wont hurt another soul. These poor people who are trying to survive get killed, imprisoned, or brainwashed into joining and there seems to be no way to stop them." The author of the following message is feeling very empathetic with an empathy score of 7 and also very distressed with a distress score of 7, "All of you know that I love birds. This article was hard for me to read because of that. Wind turbines are killing a lot of birds, including eagles. It’s really very sad. It makes me feel awful. I am all for wind turbines and renewable sources of energy because of global warming and coal, but this is awful. I don’t want these poor birds to die like this. Read this article and you’ll see why." The author of the following message is feeling moderately empathetic with an empathy score of 4 and moderately distressed with a distress score of 4, "I just read an article about wild ﬁres sending a smokey haze across the state near the Appalachian mountains. Can you imagine how big the ﬁre must be to spread so far and wide? And the people in the area obviously suffer the most. What if you have asthma or some other condition that restricts your breathing?" The author of the following message is feeling very empathetic with an empathy score of 7 and mildly distressed with a distress score of 2, "This is a very sad article. Being of of the ﬁrst female ﬁghter pilots must have given her and her family great honor. I think that there should be more training for all pilots who deal in these acrobatic ﬂying routines. I also think that women have just as much of a right to become a ﬁghter pilot as men."

Data may be preliminary.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe SuperGLUE benchmark features a set of natural language understanding\ntasks designed to evaluate and compare the performance of natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) systems. It is an extension and successor to\nthe GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a), a previous collection of nine\ntasks for evaluating NLP models. SuperGLUE was introduced in response to\nthe rapid and notable progress in many NLP tasks, led by methods such as\nELMo (Peters et al., 2018), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT\n(Devlin et al., 2019). These models were achieving or surpassing human\nperformance in many GLUE tasks, indicating the need for more challenging\ntasks.\n\nOnce meeting the policies for submission to SuperGLUE, NLP systems\nseeking to resolve the tasks of this benchmark will have their\nperformances measured in each task and placed in a comparative ranking.\nThe aggregate score in SuperGLUE, known as the ”SuperGLUE Score”, is\ncalculated by averaging the scores across all tasks.\n\nAlthough the details of each Large Language Model (LLM)’s performance in\nexecuting these tasks are available on the website, there is a certain\ndifficulty in comparing and understanding these solutions in more detail\njust by analyzing the benchmark. Therefore, some important questions for\na good understanding of the solutions arise, such as questions about the\nuse of tools, technologies, and computational power of each. These\ndetails are generally found in the articles provided by the authors and\ndevelopers of the LLMs listed in the ranking, necessitating individual\nexploration of each of these publications (and even their citation\nchains) for a better understanding of what specifically distinguishes\neach project.\n\nIn this study, the top 5 LLMs ranked on the SuperGLUE website (2023)\nwill be analyzed. These are Vega v2, the Stable and Transferable\nMixture-of-Experts (ST-MOE-32B), METRO (Model-generated dEnoising\nTRaining Objective), the Enhanced Representation through kNowledge\nIntEgration (ERNIE 3.0), and the Pathways Language Model (PaLM-540B).\nInformation contained in the publications of each of these models was\nextracted, exposing and comparing the methods and tools used to execute\nthe benchmarking tasks, and conducting a critical analysis of each\napproach.\n\nThis research is divided into the following sections: Introduction.\nTheoretical Foundation, where we provide a briefing on the tasks of\nSuperGLUE. Methodology. Results, where we perform analyses and\ncomparisons between the models. Discussion and Conclusion.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe tasks included in SuperGLUE are more challenging and diverse than\nthose in the original GLUE benchmark and were selected to test NLP\nmodels on various linguistic and cognitive abilities. They comprise a\ntotal of eight different tasks aimed at quantifying language\ncomprehension (Wang et al., 2019b). The developers of SuperGLUE followed\nseveral premises to provide a simple and robust evaluation metric for\nthe benchmark tasks:\n\n* *Task Substance* : The tasks are designed to assess a system’s\n  capability to comprehend and logically process English texts.\n* *Level of Challenge* : The tasks aim to be challenging enough that\n  they surpass the abilities of current leading-edge systems, yet can be\n  tackled by most individuals who have completed a university level\n  education in English. Tasks that required specialized knowledge in\n  certain fields, like medical records or scientific papers, were not\n  included.\n* *Evaluability* : The tasks should feature an automated scoring\n  system that accurately reflects and correlates with the quality of the\n  output. However, some tasks related to generating text do not fulfill\n  this requirement because of the limitations with automatic evaluation\n  metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Liu et\n  al., 2016).\n* *Public Data* : The tasks should utilize publicly available\n  training data to reduce the risks associated with creating new data\n  sets. A preference was shown for tasks that provided access to a\n  testing set with privately held answers.\n* *Structure of the Task* : Preference was given to tasks that have\n  straightforward input and output structures to discourage the\n  development of overly specific and complicated systems and models for\n  these challenges. The tasks within SuperGLUE involve understanding the\n  context of individual words, entire sentences, the relationship\n  between sentences, and full paragraphs.\n* *Licensing* : The data for the tasks must be freely accessible\n  under licenses that permit its use and distribution for research\n  purposes. (Wang et al., 2019b).\n\nHere is a brief explanation, according to Wang et al. (2019b), of the\neight tasks in SuperGLUE:\n\n**BoolQ** (Boolean Questions, Clark et al., 2019) is a Question\nAnswering (QA) task where each instance consists of a short passage and\na yes/no question pertaining to the passage. The questions, which are\nprovided anonymously and unsolicited by users of the Google search\nengine, are then paired with a paragraph from a Wikipedia article that\ncontains the answer. In line with the original study, this challenge is\nassessed using accuracy.\n\n**CB** (CommitmentBank, Marneffe et al., 2019) comprises a\ncollection of brief texts, each of which includes at least one sentence\nthat contains an embedded clause. These embedded clauses are annotated\nto reflect the extent to which the author seems to endorse the truth of\nthe clause. This task is approached as a three-way textual entailment\nchallenge, with examples taken from the Wall Street Journal, fictional\nworks from the British National Corpus, and Switchboard conversations.\nEach instance involves a premise with an embedded clause and a\ncorresponding hypothesis that extracts this clause. The task utilizes a\nsubset of the data where annotator agreement exceeded 80%. Given the\ndata’s imbalance (notably fewer neutral examples), it is evaluated using\nboth precision and F1 scores, with the latter calculating the unweighted\naverage F1 score per class for multi-class scenarios.\n\n**COPA** (Choice of Plausible Alternatives, Roemmele et al., 2011)\nis a causal reasoning task where a system is presented with a sentence\nas a premise and must choose either the cause or effect of the premise\nfrom two given options. All instances are manually created and revolve\naround blog posts and an encyclopedia about photography. Following the\noriginal methodology, this task is evaluated based on accuracy.\n\n**MultiRC** (Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension, Khashabi et al.,\n2018) is a QA task where each instance includes a context paragraph, a\nquestion regarding this paragraph, and a set of possible answers. The\nsystem’s job is to identify which answers are correct and which are\nincorrect. Despite the existence of many QA tasks in various benchmarks,\nMultiRC was selected for its distinct features: (i) each question may\nhave multiple correct answers, requiring independent evaluation of each\nquestion-answer pair, (ii) the questions are designed to necessitate the\nextraction of information from several sentences within the context, and\n(iii) the format of question-answer pairs is more closely aligned with\nthe API of other tasks in SuperGLUE compared to the popular\nsnippet-extraction QA format. The paragraphs are sourced from seven\ndomains, including news, fiction, and historical texts. The evaluation\nmetrics include F1 across all answer choices (F1a) and exact match of\nthe answer set for each question (EM).\n\n**ReCoRD** (Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning\nDataset, Zhang et al., 2018) is a multiple-choice Question Answering\n(QA) task. In each instance, participants are given a news article along\nwith a Cloze-style question about a sentence from the article, where a\nspecific entity is omitted. The challenge for the system is to correctly\nidentify the missing entity from a list of candidates mentioned in the\narticle excerpt. Notably, the correct entity may be referred to by\nvarious names or phrases, all of which are acceptable answers. The\nsource material for these articles includes CNN and the Daily Mail, and\nthe task is assessed by measuring both the highest F1 score at the token\nlevel and the exact match (EM) rate.\n\n**RTE** (Recognizing Textual Entailment) integrates datasets from\nfour different iterations of the RTE challenge, being RTE1 (Dagan et\nal., 2006), RTE2 (Bar Haim et al., 2006), RTE3 (Giampiccolo et al.,\n2007), and RTE5 (Bentivogli et al., 2009). These datasets are\namalgamated and reformulated into a binary classification problem,\ndistinguishing between text pairs that exhibit entailment and those that\ndo not.\n\n**WiC** (Word-in-Context, Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019)\nchallenges participants with a task of word sense disambiguation,\nformatted as a binary classification problem. Given pairs of sentences\nand a target word that appears in both, the task is to determine whether\nthe word is used in the same sense in each instance. The sentences are\nselected from a variety of sources, including WordNet (Miller, 1995),\nVerbNet (Schuler, 2005), and Wiktionary, with accuracy serving as the\ncriterion for evaluation.\n\n**WSC** (Winograd Schema Challenge, Levesque et al., 2012) focuses\non coreference resolution, presenting sentences that include a pronoun\nand a list of possible noun phrase referents within the same sentence.\nThe objective is to correctly identify to which noun phrase the pronoun\nrefers. The Winograd Schema Challenge is specifically designed to test a\nsystem’s commonsense reasoning and knowledge about the world.\n\nThe SuperGLUE benchmark encapsulates these eight tasks, categorizing\nthem into word sense disambiguation (WSD), natural language inference\n(NLI), coreference resolution (coref.), and question answering (QA). For\nthe MultiRC task specifically, the dataset contains 456 answers for\ntraining, 83 for development, and 166 for testing purposes.\n\nTable 1: SuperGLUE tasks.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Corpus** | **|Train|** | **|Dev|** | **Test** | **Task** | **Metrics** | **Texts Sources** |\n| **BoolQ** | 942 | 3270 | 3245 | QA | acc. | Google queries, Wikipedia |\n| **CB** | 250 | 57 | 250 | NLI | acc./F1 | various |\n| **COPA** | 400 | 100 | 500 | QA | acc. | blogs, photography encyclopedia |\n| **MultiRC** | 5100 | 953 | 1800 | QA | F1a/EM | various |\n| **ReCoRD** | 101k | 10k | 10k | QA | F1/EM | news (CNN, Daily Mail) |\n| **RTE** | 2500 | 278 | 300 | NLI | acc. | news, Wikipedia |\n| **WiC** | 6000 | 638 | 1400 | WSD | acc. | WordNet, VerbNet, Wiktionary |\n| **WSC** | 554 | 104 | 146 | coref. | acc. | fiction books |\n\nSource: Wang et al. (2019b)\n\nSuperGLUE also features the AX-b and AX-g metrics, which represent a set\nof sub-tasks specifically designed to test models’ comprehension in\nparticular aspects of reasoning and inference. Unlike the main\nevaluative tasks, these are included as diagnostics to assess specific\naspects of model performance (SuperGLUE, 2023).\n\n**AX-b** (Broadcoverage Diagnostics): This sub-task focuses on\ntesting the model’s ability to perform inference across a variety of\ncontexts. Derived from the GLUE diagnostic set, it includes examples\naddressing a wide range of linguistic phenomena and inference, such as\nunderstanding causal relationships, logic, world knowledge, etc. The\nmetric used is accuracy - the proportion of inferences correctly\nidentified by the model.\n\n**AX-g** (Winogender Schema Diagnostics): A sub-task specifically\ndesigned to assess gender bias in language models. Based on the\nWinogender schema (Rudinger et al., 2018), it consists of carefully\nconstructed sentences to evaluate whether a language model exhibits\ngender bias in coreference resolution tasks.\n\nAny system or approach that can generate forecasts for the SuperGLUE\nchallenges is welcome to participate, adhering to the guidelines\noutlined on the benchmark’s official site. The benchmark imposes no\nlimitations on the methodologies utilized, and there is no requirement\nfor shared parameters or simultaneous initialization across the tasks.\nThis openness encourages diverse strategies and innovations in tackling\nthe tasks (Wang et al., 2019b).\n\nThe data necessary for each task can be accessed and downloaded via the\nchallenge’s dedicated website. For every task, there’s a uniform set of\ndata including a training set, a development set, and an unlabeled test\nset—the latter being used for the submission of results. Participants\nare free to employ any external data, public or private, in the\ndevelopment of their systems. However, there are specific restrictions:\nsystems must utilize the versions of the task datasets provided by\nSuperGLUE, as these may feature unique splits of training, validation,\nand test data differing from other publicly available versions.\nAdditionally, the use of unlabeled test data from the tasks for system\ndevelopment is prohibited. The same goes for using structured source\ndata instrumental in creating the WiC labels, such as sense-annotated\nsentences from WordNet, VerbNet, and Wiktionary. Moreover, designs that\nfacilitate information sharing among distinct test instances are\ndisallowed. These rules aim to ensure fairness and integrity in the\ncompetition, focusing on the innovative application of AI and machine\nlearning techniques within defined ethical and methodological boundaries\n(Wang et al., 2019b).\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThis research adopted an exploratory strategy, which, as described by\nRobson (2002), is focused on uncovering new insights, and formulating\nideas and hypotheses for subsequent investigation. To achieve this, the\nstudy utilized both quantitative and qualitative data extracted from the\npublications of the top 5 Language Learning Models (LLMs) listed on the\nSuperGLUE benchmark’s website. Seaman (2008) argues that such a\nmixed-methods approach enhances comprehension of the subject matter\nbeing examined. The quantitative aspect involved gathering specific\ntechnical details from these publications, including the count of GPUs\nused by each model, the number of attention heads, the architectures\ndeveloped, the quantity of hidden layers, and any model modifications\ntailored to particular tasks.\n\nConversely, the qualitative component was derived from textual analysis\nand interpretation found within these documents, identifying and\ngrouping terms that shared semantic similarities. This was done\nfollowing the thematic analysis coding methodology proposed by Ezzy\n(2002), which facilitated the organization of identified concepts and\ndefinitions into coherent clusters. This step marked a transition from\ndirect information presented in the publications to a more digested form\nof analysis, creating a secondary resource that offered both a synthetic\nand analytical overview of the original material, guided by established\ntheoretical frameworks (Liamputtong and Ezzy, 2009). Notably, this\nthematic coding was executed without the reliance on any specific tools\nfor qualitative analysis or alternative coding techniques. Spreadsheets\nwere used to code information not necessarily explicit but that could be\nrelevant for the comparison between the LLMs, such as limitations and\nstrengths of the models, characteristics of pre-training tasks, etc.\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the models analyzed are Vega v2,\nST-MOE-32B, METRO, ERNIE 3.0, and PaLM-540B, in this order. All these\nmodels have links to their publications on the SuperGLUE website\ndetailing their architectures, technologies, and methods used for\nexecuting the tasks of this benchmarking. Some of these publications did\nnot provide all the expected details; however, through the extension of\nthe search through reference articles, it was possible to extract a\nrelevant base for comparison between the models.\n\n**Results**\n\nThis section will consist of two stages. In the first stage, the\napproaches and nuances of each language model used in solving the\nchallenges proposed in the SuperGLUE benchmark will be analyzed\nindividually. The models will be presented in the order of their\nrankings based on their performance during the execution of the\nbenchmarking task. Key architectural features, functionalities,\npre-training tasks, and other information derived from a qualitative\nanalysis of the available literature on these models will be elucidated.\n\nIn the second stage, a comparison will be made between the models\nthrough graphs and tables, resulting from the quantitative analysis of\nthe information of these LLMs, as well as their performance in executing\nthe SuperGLUE tasks.\n\n**1st - Vega V2**\n\nThis model was developed by researchers from the following universities\nand research centers: Wuhan University, JD Explore Academy, JD.com Inc.,\nShanghai AI Lab, Nanyang Technological University, University of Sydney,\nWashington University in St Louis, and Chongqing University of Posts and\nTelecommunications. The Vega V2 model has set new benchmarks, achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) outcomes in half of the SuperGlue benchmark’s\ntasks. This model introduces a novel approach to learning, termed\nself-evolutionary learning, which is designed to enhance the prediction\nof tokens that are most informative and should therefore be masked\nduring training. This mechanism is specifically applied to improve the\neffectiveness of the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) process. By\nemploying smoothed and rectified labels for supervision, Vega V2 aims to\nrefine the training process, potentially leading to more accurate and\nrobust model performance across various linguistic tasks. This strategy\nsuggests a significant advancement in the field of natural language\nprocessing (NLP), particularly in how models learn from and adapt to\ntextual data.\n\nMoreover, for downstream adaptation, the model employs a prompt transfer\ntechnique based on knowledge distillation to enhance performance in\nresource-limited tasks. It focuses on extracting knowledge from\npre-training data and effectively transferring it to downstream tasks\n(Zhong et al., 2022). Additional characteristics of its architecture and\npre-training structures include:\n\n*Architecture* : Based on the Transformer structure (Vaswani et\nal., 2017), but it distinguishes itself by incorporating unlinked\nattention mechanisms. It implements two fine-tuning strategies to\nenhance its learning capability and adaptability. The first strategy\nemploys a self-evolutionary learning approach, which unfolds in two\npivotal steps aimed at mining the data’s intrinsic knowledge for a\npretrained Language Model (PLM). Initially, the PLM engages in a\nself-questioning process to identify challenging and informative\nwords. Subsequently, it oversees the Masked Language Modeling (MLM)\nprocess, employing smoothed and rectified labels to ensure a more\nnuanced supervision. The second strategy, known as prompt transfer, is\ndesigned to efficiently tailor the model to downstream tasks,\nparticularly those with limited resources. This is achieved by\nharnessing knowledge from both the base model and tasks that are\nrelated but have been previously learned, allowing for a more\neffective transfer of learning.\n\n*Pre-training* : Vega V2 leveraged a diverse corpus, incorporating\ndata from the English Wikipedia dump (10 GB), BookCorpus (Zhu et al.,\n2015) (6 GB), OpenwebText (38 GB), Stories (31 GB), and CC-News (Trinh\nand Le, 2018) (76 GB). Unlike traditional MLM approaches that mask\ntokens randomly, Vega V2 introduces an Informative Token Prediction\nfeature. This feature uses the model’s self-evolutionary learning\nmechanism to strategically predict which tokens to mask, focusing on\nthose that present more significant learning opportunities or\nchallenges. This method allows Vega V2 to concentrate on the nuances\nand complexities of the text, potentially leading to a deeper\nunderstanding and better overall model performance.\n\n**2nd - ST-MOE**\n\nCrafted by Google’s research team, the Stable and Transferable\nMixture-of-Experts (ST-MOE-32B) model outperformed its predecessor,\nregistering an impressive average score of 91.2 on the test server and\nachieving a validation accuracy of 93.2. This validation accuracy\nsurpasses human performance benchmarks by more than a percentage point,\nas estimated by the benchmark itself. Built upon the foundational\nTransformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), it incorporates an\nencoder/decoder framework. The encoder fully engages in all-to-all\nattention with the inputs, while the decoder, in an autoregressive\nfashion, pays attention to both the encoder outputs and its inputs. The\nmodel adapts to particular challenges through a process of fine-tuning.\nHighlighted below are the primary features of its architecture and the\napproaches employed during its pre-training phase:\n\n*Architecture* : The ST-MOE models incorporate 32 ”experts,” which\nserve as crucial elements substituting a layer within the neural\nnetwork, with each expert possessing its distinct set of weights.\nTypically, the experts within a given layer are uniform in type and\nstructure (homogeneous), though it’s feasible to integrate experts of\ndifferent varieties (heterogeneous). This configuration allows for\ninputs to be processed exclusively by a selected subset of experts,\nthereby optimizing computational efficiency for certain training\nscenarios. Consequently, the model includes a mechanism to select the\nspecific experts tasked with processing each segment of the input\ndata. An expert layer is interspersed at a frequency of 1/4,\nindicating that every fourth Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layer is\nswapped out for a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer. Across both the\nencoder and decoder, the architecture integrates six sparse layers,\neach equipped with 32 experts (Zoph et al., 2022).\n\n*Pre-training* : The pre-training process of ST-MoE-32B involves\nreplacing every fourth Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layer with a Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) layer. This structure is repeated throughout the\nmodel’s architecture, providing a balance between FFN and MoE\ncomponents. The model is pre-trained on 1.5 trillion tokens. This\npre-training step utilizes a mix of the C4 dataset, which is English\nonly, and the GLaM dataset. The Adafactor optimizer (Zoph et al.,\n2022) is employed with standard hyperparameters. The concept of\n”router z-loss” was introduced to address instability issues and\nincludes a detailed analysis of fine-tuning techniques for sparse and\ndense models, highlighting their different sensitivities to\nhyperparameters.\n\n**3rd - Metro**\n\nThe Model-generated dEnoising TRaining Objective (Metro) was developed\nby researchers at Microsoft, setting new records in the GLUE, SuperGLUE,\nand SQuAD benchmarks. It is an autoencoding model that utilizes\nsupervised learning with the generation of synthetic training data for\nits enhancement. One of the main features of the Metro-LM is its ability\nto understand and generate text in multiple languages.\n\nMetro employs a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) architecture\ncomprising a main and an auxiliary model, following the standard\ntraining configuration base of ELECTRA. The auxiliary model uses the\nMasked Language Modeling - MLM (Devlin et al., 2019) pre-training\ntechnique, and the main model is trained using Replaced Token Detection\n- RTD (Clark et al., 2020) tasks. The training corpus consists of 160 GB\nof text from Wikipedia, BookCorpus, STORIES, CC-News, and OpenWebText.\nIt utilizes supervised learning with the generation of synthetic\ntraining data to enhance the quality of the model (Bajaj et al., 2022).\nOther characteristics are as follows:\n\n* *Architecture* : In addition to the above information, the\n  following architectural strategies were addressed in this model:\n* Shallow and Wide Auxiliary Model (Meng et al., 2021): This\n  architecture employs an auxiliary model that is ”shallow and wide,”\n  meaning it has fewer layers (shallow) but more processing units per\n  layer (wide). This configuration is useful for generating effective\n  training signals for the main model, improving learning efficiency\n  without significantly increasing computational complexity.\n* Post LayerNorm (Devlin et al., 2019): Introduced with BERT, Post\n  LayerNorm applies layer normalization (LayerNorm) after the\n  self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) operations in each\n  Transformer block. This aids in stabilizing training and\n  accelerating convergence.\n* Relative Position Embedding (Raffel et al., 2019): Used in the T5\n  model, this technique integrates information pertaining to the\n  relative positioning of tokens within a sequence. This method\n  diverges from traditional absolute position encodings by enabling\n  the model to grasp the positional interrelations among words without\n  being tied to their fixed positions in the text sequence. This\n  flexibility allows for a more dynamic understanding of text\n  structure, enhancing the model’s ability to process and interpret\n  language data effectively.\n* TUPE Decoupled [CLS] Position Embedding (Ke et al., 2020): TUPE\n  (Transformer with Untied Positional Embeddings) introduces an\n  approach where positional encodings are decoupled from word\n  embeddings. Additionally, the position of the [CLS] token is\n  reinitialized, which can be particularly useful in tasks that rely\n  on the global representation of the sequence, such as text\n  classification.\n\n*Pre-training* : An auxiliary Transformer model first generates\ncontextual representations for each token, which the language model\nhead then uses to produce a softmax distribution across the\nvocabulary. This auxiliary model undergoes pre-training to identify\nand restore masked tokens, employing the conventional language\nmodeling loss for this purpose. Subsequently, it’s utilized to\nintentionally introduce errors into text sequences as part of the main\nmodel’s training regimen. Distributed training methodologies are\nemployed, specifically the ZeRO optimizer and Custom Fused CUDA\nOperations, to enhance efficiency. The DeepSpeed ZeRO optimizer\n(Rajbhandari et al., 2020), efficiently distributes optimizer states,\ngradients, and model parameters across multiple GPUs during\ndistributed training. To reduce the computational overhead associated\nwith toggling between FP32 (32-bit Floating Point) and FP16 precision\nlevels, fused CUDA operations are implemented. These custom CUDA\nkernels consolidate the process of converting to FP32 and performing\noperations, executing element-wise conversion and computation while\noptimizing computational locality for heightened efficiency, as\ndetailed by Bajaj et al. (2022). In this pre-training approach, the\nintegrity of document boundaries is preserved, meaning texts from\nseparate documents are not merged into a singular pre-training\nsequence.\n\n**4th - ERNIE 3.0**\n\nThe approach known as ERNIE 3.0 is a pre-trained language model\ndeveloped by Baidu, aiming to be a generic language model capable of\nhandling a wide variety of problems within this scope. The name ”ERNIE”\nstands for ”Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration,”\nindicating the model’s ability to integrate knowledge and contextual\ninformation to improve the understanding of natural language. This\nstrategy was subjected to several benchmarks besides SuperGLUE, showing\npromising performance in all of them. Its learning structure is equipped\nwith a regressive network complemented by an auto-decoding strategy. It\ndiffers from other strategies discussed in this project by allowing, in\naddition to fine-tuning rounds for solving specific problems, zero-shot\nand few-shot training approaches. This enables the model to be\ncalibrated with diverse problems beyond textual scope, including\nadaptability and applicability in image classification, audio, and\ndatasets with various contexts.\n\nERNIE 3.0 ranks fourth (as of now) among all approaches applied to\nSuperGLUE (2023), surpassing human performance in more than 54 diverse\nlanguage tasks. Its initial training strategy uses an unsupervised\ncorpus with simple texts in Chinese, as well as a knowledge graph\ngenerated by the interaction of tokens.\n\nAs its name suggests, this version utilizes the multi-task framework\nfrom its previous iteration (2.0), with lower layers shared across all\nneural structures, and upper layers that can be specifically trained\ndepending on the scope of the tasks the tool will be exposed to. Figure\n1 depicts the structure of the ERNIE 3.0 model, which features a\nsynergistic design consisting of a Universal Representation Module\ncoupled with two specialized Task-Specific Representation Modules for\nnatural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation\n(NLG), respectively. At its core, this model leverages a multi-layer\nTransformer-XL network. The Transformer-XL builds upon the standard\nTransformer framework by incorporating an additional recurrent memory\nmodule, designed to enhance the model’s capability in handling extended\ntext sequences (Sun et al., 2021). This architectural choice enables\nERNIE 3.0 to maintain a broad spectrum of language processing tasks by\neffectively capturing and representing the nuances of both short and\nlong text passages.\n\nFigure 1: ERNIE 3.0 architecture\n\nSource: Sun et al. (2021)\n\nERNIE 3.0 is an LLM (Large Language Model) employing a regressive and\nautoencoding network approach, with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning\nlearning methods. The Chinese corpus used for training consists of 4TB\nof unsupervised data, including simple texts and a knowledge graph,\nspread across 11 different categories. As functional characteristics,\nthis model can be adapted for tasks involving natural language\nunderstanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) and supports the integration of\nvarious tasks, which are trained through multi-task learning. Here are\nsome specific details about this model:\n\n*Architecture* : ERNIE 3.0 builds upon the continuous multi-task\nlearning framework that was a hallmark of ERNIE 2.0, incorporating a\ncooperative structure that combines a Universal Representation Module\nwith two Task-Specific Representation Modules designed for natural\nlanguage understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG),\nrespectively. Central to this model is the implementation of a\nmulti-layer Transformer-XL network, which serves as the primary\narchitecture for both the universal and task-specific modules. The\nTask-Specific Representation Modules, also based on the multi-layer\nTransformer-XL, are tailored to capture sophisticated semantic\nrepresentations suited to various language processing tasks. A key\ninnovation in ERNIE 3.0 is its Enhanced Recurrent Memory Mechanism, a\nsignificant departure from the conventional recurrent Transformer\napproach. This mechanism optimizes the model’s ability to process and\nretain information over longer textual contexts by modifying the\npattern of recurrence. Instead of having the recurrence move down\nthrough each layer, it recurs within the same layer, allowing ERNIE\n3.0 to handle extended effective context lengths more efficiently.\nThis adaptation not only enhances the model’s comprehension and\ngeneration capabilities but also enables it to achieve superior\nperformance across a wide array of language processing tasks.\n\n*Pre-training* : The pre-training phases of this model encompass\nthree distinct types: natural language understanding (NLU), natural\nlanguage generation (NLG), and knowledge extraction, collectively\nreferred to as ”Continuous Multi-Paradigm Pre-training.” To bolster\nlexical information capture, ERNIE 3.0 enhances the NLU network\nthrough masked language modeling and knowledge-based training.\nAdditionally, it undertakes sentence reordering and sentence distance\ndiscernment tasks to fortify syntactic information acquisition. The\nmodel leverages universal text-knowledge prediction tasks to augment\nits capabilities in knowledge retention and logical reasoning.\nConcurrently, the NLG network is developed through document language\nmodeling tasks, facilitating a range of generative styles. A notable\ntechnique employed by this model is deduplication at various\nlevels—character, paragraph, and document—wherein successive\nidentical characters (including spaces, tabs, punctuation marks, etc.)\nare consolidated into a single character. Likewise, repeated composite\nparagraphs are condensed to a single paragraph containing N sentences,\nwith 0 < N < 100. To eliminate duplicate\ndocuments, the model employs the Message Digest Algorithm 5 - MD5\n(Rivest, 1992). Sentences shorter than 10 words are excluded, and\nsentence and word segmentation are performed using regular expressions\nand Baidu’s word segmentation tool, respectively. To enhance data\nvariety for the NLU network’s pre-training, each dataset is scaled by\na pre-defined factor after initial data truncation. The training\nvocabulary, in addition to the Chinese corpus, includes a dataset\ncomprising 10,000 English words (Sun et al., 2021).\n\n**5th - PaLM**\n\nThe Pathways Language Model (PaLM) is a model developed by researchers\nat Google in April 2022. It is an autoregressive, decoder-only,\ngenerative-focused model. PaLM 540B surpasses the previous\nstate-of-the-art in 24 out of 29 tasks in the 1-example (1-shot)\nscenario and in 28 out of 29 tasks in the few-shot scenario. Trained for\nvarious types of tasks, it performs zero-shot and few-shot learning.\nPaLM is capable of handling a wide range of languages and has been\nimplemented in various benchmarkings. It employs a semi-supervised\napproach, combining techniques of supervised and unsupervised learning\nduring training. It features the standard Transformer model architecture\n(Vaswani et al., 2017) in a decoder-only configuration (Chowdhery et\nal., 2023) and a Pathways system for more efficient computation. The\nmain datasets used for training are Wikipedia, webpages, books, news\narticles, social media conversations, and source code. Among the five\nmodels presented in this work, PaLM is the largest in terms of training\ndata quantity and computational resources, which will be detailed in the\ncomparison section. Some other key features of its architecture and\npre-training are given below:\n\n*Architecture* : This model incorporates several enhancements to\nthe traditional Transformer framework for improved efficacy. Notably,\nit utilizes SwiGLU activation in place of conventional activation\nfunctions like ReLU, GeLU, or Swish for intermediate MLP activations\nto significantly enhance performance (Shazeer, 2020). A novel\n”parallel” approach is adopted within each Transformer block, as\ndescribed by Wang & Komatsuzaki (2021), diverging from the\ntraditional ”serialized” structure, which accelerates training speeds\nby approximately 15% at large scales. Additionally, the model\nintroduces a multi-query attention mechanism where key/value\nprojections are shared across each head, thus ”key” and ”value” are\nprojected to [1; h] dimensions, whereas ”query” projections remain\nat [k; h]. This adjustment does not affect model quality or\ntraining speed but offers substantial savings in computational costs\nduring autoregressive decoding processes (Chowdhery et al., 2023).\n\n*Pre-training* : The SentencePiece vocabulary system (Kudo &\nRichardson, 2018) with 256k tokens was utilized. The corpus for\ntraining encompasses 780 billion tokens. The primary training\nmethodologies include the chain-of-thought, fine-tuning, and\ncalculator approaches, the latter being employed for arithmetic\nreasoning datasets with the aid of a post-hoc external calculator.\nTask representation is achieved through few-shot prompting. While the\nPaLM implementation explores various techniques, this summary focuses\non the principal strategies. For a more comprehensive understanding,\nthe detailed publication by Chowdhery et al. (2023) is recommended as\na resource.\n\n**Comparison between models**\n\nIn this section, we will present comparisons between the models through\nmore quantitative analyses. It’s important to note that some models\nexecuted SuperGLUE tasks using different instances of their\narchitectures, resulting in varying scores published on the benchmarking\nwebsite. However, this work will present the best results among these\nmodel instances in executing the SuperGLUE tasks. Table 2 displays the\nresults obtained among the models. Vega V2 ranks first with an average\nscore of 91.3, followed by ST-MOE with 91.2, METRO (90.9), ERNIE 3.0\n(90.6), and in fifth place, PaLM (90.4).\n\nTable 2 - Ranking SuperGLUE (2023)\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** | **SuperGLUE - Leaderboard Version: 2.0** |\n| **Rank** | **Model** | **Score** | **BoolQ** | **CB** | **COPA** | **MultiRC** | **ReCoRD** | **RTE** | **WiC** | **WSC** | **AX-b** | **AX-g** |\n| 1 | Vega v2 | **91.3** | 90.5 | **98.6/99.2** | **99.4** | 88.2/62.4 | 94.4/93.9 | **96.0** | 77.4 | **98.6** | -0.4 | **100.0/50.0** |\n| 2 | ST-MoE | **91.2** | **92.4** | 96.9/98.0 | 99.2 | **89.6/65.8** | 95.1/94.4 | 93.5 | **77.7** | 96.6 | 72.3 | 96.1/94.1 |\n| 3 | METRO | **90.9** | 92.0 | 95.9/97.6 | 98.2 | 88.4/63.0 | **96.4/95.9** | 94.1 | 77.1 | 97.3 | 67.8 | 93.3/95.5 |\n| 4 | ERNIE 3.0 | **90.6** | 91.0 | **98.6/99.2** | 97.4 | 88.6/63.2 | 94.7/94.2 | 92.6 | 77.4 | 97.3 | 68.6 | 92.7/94.7 |\n| 5 | PaLM | **90.4** | 91.9 | 94.4/96.0 | 99.0 | 88.7/63.6 | 94.2/93.3 | 94.1 | 77.4 | 95.9 | **72.9** | 95.5/90.4 |\n\nSource: SuperGLUE(2023)\n\nAs we analyze these results, it’s crucial to consider not just the\noverall scores but also the specific tasks where each model excels. This\ncan give insights into their respective strengths and potential areas\nfor improvement. Furthermore, the differences in their architectures,\ntraining methods, and datasets used for training might provide a deeper\nunderstanding of why certain models perform better in specific tasks.\n\nThe tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark can be categorized according to\ntheir objectives and contexts (SuperGLUE, 2023). The categories include\ntasks that require reading comprehension and inference (BoolQ, MultiRC,\nReCoRD), tasks demanding causal and consequential reasoning (COPA, RTE),\ntasks for understanding context and polysemy (WiC, CB), and the\nchallenge for pronoun comprehension and reasoning (WSC). There are also\ndiagnostic tasks (AX-b and AX-g). This categorization allows us to\nidentify some of the strengths of each model as presented in Table 2.\nFor instance, Vega V2, with its standout performance in CB, COPA, RTE,\nWSC, and the subtask AX-g, emerges as a well-balanced model for\nchallenges related to causal reasoning, context understanding, and\ndiagnostic tasks. ST-MOE, on the other hand, excelled in Boolq and\nMultiRC, which are related to context understanding and reading\ncomprehension. METRO showed strength in reading comprehension tasks.\nERNIE 3.0 was strong in context understanding, and PaLM excelled in\ndiagnostic tasks. It should be noted that this is a general\ninterpretation based on a partial analysis of the results obtained in\nthe SuperGLUE tasks by each model, and a more in-depth analysis is\nrequired for a better classification.\n\nIn Figure 2, the differences between the models can be observed in terms\nof the number of parameters (in billions) used in pre-training and the\nnumber of layers in their architectures. This comparison provides\ninsights into the scale and complexity of these models. The number of\nparameters and layers are indicative of the model’s potential capacity\nfor learning and handling complex language tasks. However, it’s also\ncrucial to note that more parameters and layers do not automatically\ntranslate to better performance on all tasks. The effectiveness of a\nmodel also depends on how well it has been trained, the quality of its\ntraining data, and its specific architecture and algorithms. Therefore,\nwhile quantitative measures like the number of parameters and layers\nprovide valuable information, they are just one part of the overall\npicture of these advanced language models.\n\nFigure 2 - Comparison between models regarding the number of parameters\nand layers\n\nSource: Own author\n\nThe Vega V2 is the model that utilized the fewest layers (24) and\nmanaged to achieve a higher average in the execution of the SuperGLUE\ntasks with 6 billion parameters. PaLM is the model with the highest\nnumber of parameters used for training, followed by ST-MOE. ERNIE 3.0\nemployed 10 billion parameters and 48 layers. METRO, in its publication,\nmentions the use of 5.4 billion parameters for training; however, an\nadditional 600 million are added for the training of the auxiliary\nmodule. Consequently, we decided to include these in the total for\ncomparison with other models, amounting to 6 billion parameters, thereby\nequating to the quantity used in Vega V2. Figure 3 illustrates the\nnumber of attention heads used in each of the models.\n\nFigure 3 - Number of attention heads in each model\n\nSource: Own author\n\nIt is observed that Vega V2 has the smallest number of attention heads\namong the models compared. PaLM, despite being the largest model in\nterms of parameters and layers, has fewer attention heads than ST-MOE\nand ERNIE 3.0.\n\nThis observation points to a nuanced aspect of model design, where the\nnumber of attention heads does not necessarily correlate directly with\nthe size of the model in terms of parameters and layers. Attention heads\nare a crucial component in Transformer models, contributing to their\nability to process different parts of the input data in parallel, thus\nenhancing their capacity for understanding complex language structures\nand relationships. The variance in the number of attention heads among\nthese models indicates diverse approaches to handling and processing\nlanguage data. The lack of information on the maximum context sequence\nlength for Vega V2 highlights a gap in available data, which could be\nimportant for fully understanding the model’s capabilities and areas of\nspecialization.\n\nThe maximum context sequence length is shown in Figure 4. However,\ninformation regarding this aspect for the Vega V2 model was not found.\n\nFigura 4 - Quantidade máxima de sequência de contexto\n\nSource: Own author\n\nPaLM is the model that uses the longest context sequence for training,\nwith a length of up to 2048 tokens. ERNIE 3.0 and METRO use a sequence\nlength of 512 tokens, while ST-MOE utilizes a total of 626 tokens, where\n512 are for the encoder and 114 for the decoder.\n\nIn Table 3, we have listed other relevant information that was disclosed\nin the publications of the models. However, some data were not\nexplicitly presented, so unavailable data are marked as N.A. (not\navailable).\n\nTable 3: Resources Used in the Models\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Resources** | **Vega v2** | **ST-MOE** | **Metro** | **ERNIE 3.0** | **PaLM** |\n| **GPU or TPU** | 320 GPUs A100 | N.A. | 256 GPUs A100 | 384 GPUs V100 | 6144 TPU V4 |\n| **Hidden** | 4096 | N.A. | 2560 | 4096 + 768 | N.A. |\n| **Batch size / Steps** | N.A. / 1M + 50K | 1M tokens/batch /100K | 2048/ 2M | 6144 / 10K | 2048 / 255K |\n| **Optimizer** | AdamW | Adafactor (standard) | Adam - 1e-6, β1 = 0,9, β2 = 0,98 | Adam - 1e-4, β1 = 0,9, β2 = 0,999 | Adafactor 10-2, β1 = 0,9, β2 = 0,99 |\n| **Tokens (Billions)** | N.A. | 1500 | N.A. | 375 | 780 |\n\nSource: Own author\n\nThis table provides a detailed comparison of the models, including\nvarious aspects such as sequence length, number of parameters, layers,\nattention heads, and other specific attributes. The marking of N.A. for\ncertain data points acknowledges the limits of the available information\nand ensures clarity and accuracy in the comparative analysis.\nUnderstanding these attributes is crucial for a comprehensive assessment\nof each model’s design and potential applications. This kind of\ncomparative analysis is essential for researchers and practitioners in\nthe field to make informed decisions about which models might be best\nsuited for specific tasks or research objectives.\n\nAs observed, PaLM uses a significantly higher number of processors\ncompared to other models. Specifically, it employs 6144 TPUs V4, which\nare specialized processors designed by Google. TPUs are also used in\nST-MOE, but the exact number utilized for executing the SuperGLUE tasks\nin this model has not been disclosed. The other models use NVIDIA GPUs.\nVega V2 was processed with 320 A100 GPUs, METRO with 256, and ERNIE 3.0\nwith 384 V100 GPUs.\n\nInformation about the use of hidden layers was not disclosed for the\nST-MOE and PaLM models (both from Google). ERNIE 3.0 used 4096 in the\nuniversal representation module and an additional 768 for the\ntask-specific representation module.\n\nRegarding batch size/steps, Vega V2 only specified that 1 million steps\nwere used for training in the first phase and an additional 50 thousand\nin the second. ST-MOE did not disclose the batch size but mentioned that\nit used 1 million tokens per batch over a total of 100 thousand steps.\nThe AdamW optimizer was used in Vega V2, but data on its hyperparameters\nwere not disclosed. Adafactor was used in the PaLM models (10-2, β1 =\n0.9, β2 = 0.99) and ST-MOE (only disclosed as a standard configuration).\nERNIE 3.0 and METRO used the Adam optimizer. The number of tokens used\nfor training was not disclosed for Vega V2 and METRO. For the other\nmodels, the values are in billions of tokens.\n\nThe differences in processors, GPUs, batch sizes, optimizers, and\ntraining steps reflect the varied strategies and priorities in model\ndevelopment, influencing their performance and applicability in\ndifferent tasks and contexts. Understanding these technical details is\ncrucial for researchers and developers in AI and NLP fields, helping to\ngauge the practical requirements and potential of each model.\n\nThe analysis of NLP models Vega V2, ST-MOE-32B, METRO, ERNIE 3.0, and\nPaLM-540B provides significant insights into each and highlights the\ncurrent state and trends in the field of artificial intelligence.\nFirstly, the diversity in the architectures of these models demonstrates\nthat there is no one-size-fits-all approach to NLP tasks, reinforcing\nthe notion that specialization and innovation are crucial for\nsignificant advancements. Additionally, their performance on specific\nSuperGLUE tasks suggests that while we have made considerable progress\nin some areas, substantial challenges remain in others, such as\nunderstanding linguistic nuances and complex contexts.\n\nAnother notable point is the importance of pre-training. The differences\nin pre-training strategies among the models indicate that how data are\nused before specific task training has a substantial impact on\nperformance and the types of tasks in which each model excels. This\nimplies that more research should be directed towards better\nunderstanding pre-training techniques and data selection.\n\nWhile the analysis highlights a growing trend in creating larger and\nmore complex NLP models like PaLM and ST-MOE, it is also evident that\nsmaller, task-focused models like Vega V2 can achieve excellent results.\nSignificant advancements in the performance of these models also raise\nquestions about energy efficiency, accessibility, and ethics in AI,\npointing to the need for a more balanced approach where performance\ninnovations are weighed with considerations of environmental and social\nimpact. Therefore, studying SuperGLUE and current NLP models provides a\ncomprehensive view of the advancements and challenges in the field of\nNLP, indicating directions for future research and development.\n\nThis study aims to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) models - Vega V2, ST-MOE-32B, METRO,\nERNIE 3.0, and PaLM-540B - that stood out in the SuperGLUE ranking in\nDecember 2023. This research not only details the key characteristics\nand performance of these models in benchmarking tasks but also offers\ninsights into the correlation between model size, processing resources,\nthe volume of pre-training data, and effectiveness in specific tasks.\nAdditionally, the study highlights the innovative techniques and\narchitectures employed by these models to set new standards in the field\nof AI.\n\nMore than just a technical assessment, this study contributes to\nunderstanding the current and future progress in the field of AI. By\nelucidating the potential and limitations of cutting-edge models, it\nencourages the continuation of research and development in this sector.\nWe believe the findings presented here can inspire new investigations,\nimprovements, and practical applications of AI in various sectors,\nleveraging the unique strengths of each model. Thus, this work not only\nadvances knowledge in the NLP area but also paves the way for\ninnovations that can transform various aspects of our society.\n\nBajaj, P., Xiong, C., Ke, G., Liu, X., He, D., Tiwary, S., … & Gao,\nJ. 2022.

The process of LLM benchmarking plays a central role in evaluating these models' effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability to real-world tasks. By systematically comparing LLMs against standardized tasks and metrics, stakeholders can gauge a model's strengths and weaknesses, guiding the development of more sophisticated and capable language models.\xa0  \n\xa0  \nFor businesses, the benefits of LLM benchmarking extend beyond mere technical evaluation. Benchmarking provides a foundation for strategic decision-making, enabling companies to select the most suitable models for their specific applications. Whether for enhancing customer service through chatbots or improving content generation, the insights gained from benchmarking can drive innovation, optimize operational efficiencies, and create competitive advantages in the marketplace.\n\nCrucially, LLM benchmarking facilitates informed product development decisions. By understanding how different LLMs perform on various tasks and metrics, businesses can tailor their development efforts to address specific needs, prioritize features that offer the most value, and allocate resources more effectively.\n\n## Key metrics for LLM benchmarking\n\nIdentifying the right metrics is fundamental to effective LLM benchmarking. These metrics should comprehensively cover aspects of LLM performance, including but not limited to:\n\nTogether, these metrics provide a holistic view of an LLM’s capabilities.\n\nWhen comparing language models, it's necessary to evaluate them based on:\n\nThese dimensions are critical for businesses that require high-performing, cost-effective, and scalable solutions for their AI-driven applications.\n\nEvaluating LLM features at scale necessitates advanced tools and methodologies. Tools that can automate the evaluation process, handle large datasets, and simulate real-world scenarios are invaluable. They enable businesses to conduct thorough LLM evaluations, ensuring that the chosen models can meet demands for high-quality, efficient, and scalable language processing capabilities. This comprehensive evaluation process is essential for leveraging the full potential of [generative AI](/insights/ai-and-machine-learning/the-generative-ai-technology-stack) in business applications.\n\n## Challenges and limitations of LLM benchmarking\n\nOne significant challenge is the dynamic nature of language itself, which can lead to benchmarks that quickly become outdated as language use evolves. Additionally, due to the complexity and diversity of tasks that LLMs are expected to perform, no single benchmark can adequately capture a model's overall capabilities. This necessitates a suite of benchmarks to evaluate different aspects of LLM performance comprehensively.\n\nBenchmarking methodologies can also introduce biases and pitfalls that skew the evaluation of LLMs. For instance, benchmarks might favor models trained on specific types of data or those optimized for particular metrics, such as accuracy, at the expense of other important factors, like fairness or robustness. Recognizing and addressing these biases is essential for objective and reliable model comparisons. This involves designing benchmarks that are inclusive and representative of the diverse range of tasks and contexts in which LLMs operate.\n\nEnsuring fair and reliable comparisons among different LLMs requires a standardized approach to benchmarking. Variations in how models are tested and evaluated can lead to inconsistent and misleading results. Establishing common benchmarking protocols and metrics allows for more accurate comparisons, facilitating the identification of the most effective models for specific applications. This standardization is a critical step toward advancing the field of LLMs and maximizing their utility in real-world applications.\n\n## Best practices for LLM benchmarking\n\nBest practices in LLM benchmarking are vital for achieving accurate and reliable results. Carefully select benchmarks relevant to the specific tasks the LLM will perform to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the model's capabilities. Use diverse datasets to test the model across a wide range of scenarios, minimizing the risk of bias and ensuring the model's robustness and versatility.\n\nCreate standardized frameworks for LLM evaluation to significantly enhance the benchmarking process. Frameworks provide consistent guidelines for conducting benchmarks, analyzing results, and reporting findings. They facilitate comparisons across different LLMs by ensuring that all models are evaluated under the same conditions and according to the same criteria. Standardized frameworks also help with identifying areas where models excel or need improvement, guiding future development efforts.\n\nCollaboration among experts in the field is necessary for establishing and refining benchmarking standards. By pooling knowledge and resources, the [AI/ML](/insights/ai-and-machine-learning) community can develop more sophisticated and comprehensive benchmarks that accurately reflect the complexities of natural language processing tasks. This collaborative approach also promotes the sharing of best practices and innovations in LLM evaluation, driving the continuous improvement of benchmarking methodologies and the development of more advanced and capable language models.\n\n## LLM leaderboards unlock business success\n\nThe significance of LLM leaderboards extends beyond mere rankings. They serve as benchmarking tools that provide valuable insights into the capabilities and performance of various language models. By participating in open LLM leaderboards, businesses can gauge how their models stack up against the competition, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. This competitive analysis can inform strategic decisions, from refining model architectures to optimizing training datasets, ultimately enhancing the model's performance and business utility.\n\nCompanies looking to leverage generative AI technologies should understand the business benefits of participating in LLM leaderboards:\n\nTo improve language model performance and rankings on LLM leaderboards, adopt a strategy of technical optimization and strategic planning. This encompasses continuous model training with diverse and high-quality datasets, advanced machine learning techniques, and fine-tuning of model parameters for specific tasks. Additionally, companies should stay informed about the latest developments in AI and machine learning, adopting new approaches and technologies that can enhance their model capabilities. By focusing on both innovation and strategic positioning, businesses can climb the LLM leaderboards and achieve success in the competitive landscape of generative AI.\n\n## The future of LLM benchmarking\n\nEmerging trends in LLM benchmarking indicate a shift toward more holistic and nuanced evaluation methods. As the field of generative AI continues to evolve, there’s a growing recognition of the need for benchmarks that not only assess traditional metrics, like accuracy and efficiency, but also consider factors like fairness, interpretability, and environmental impact. This broader approach to benchmarking is essential for developing powerful, ethical, and sustainable LLMs.\n\nAdvancements in AI technologies and methodologies will determine the future of language model evaluation. Benchmarks are likely to become more sophisticated—and more capable of accurately simulating a range of real-world scenarios. Additionally, the use of automated benchmarking tools and platforms is likely to increase, enabling more frequent and comprehensive evaluations of LLMs. These advancements will support the continuous improvement of language models, ensuring their effectiveness and relevance in an ever-changing technological landscape.\n\nAdapting to changing industry needs and requirements is a critical LLM benchmarking challenge. As businesses and consumers demand more from generative AI, benchmarks will need to evolve to assess models' abilities to meet these expectations. Evaluating models on new and emerging tasks, incorporating user feedback into benchmarking processes, and ensuring that models are aligned with ethical standards and societal values are crucial. By staying responsive to these changes, companies using LLM benchmarking can support the development of language models that drive innovation and deliver value across a wide range of applications.\n\n## LLM benchmarking FAQs\n\n### What’s the purpose of LLM evaluation and benchmarking?\n\nLLM evaluation and benchmarking are used to systematically assess the capabilities and performance of large language models across various dimensions, including accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and more.

However, at Novus, we understand the importance of approaching benchmark results with a critical eye, recognizing both their value and limitations.\n\nWe ensure that all of our models are extensively evaluated on a variety of benchmarks, including different in-house assessments. This comprehensive approach allows us to gain a nuanced understanding of our models' capabilities. Importantly, we don't stop at traditional performance metrics. We also place a strong emphasis on evaluating the safety and alignment of these models, recognizing the ethical implications of deploying powerful AI systems.\n\nWhile we believe that benchmarks provide valuable insights, we know they don't tell the whole story when it comes to determining the quality of these models. That's why we complement our benchmark evaluations with extensive human testing. This hands-on approach ensures that we can assess the real-world applications and practical usefulness of our models.\n\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with language models at Novus, we're committed to evolving our evaluation methods in tandem.\n\nOur goal is to develop and refine assessment techniques that allow us to accurately gauge and harness the full potential of these powerful tools, always keeping in mind their practical impact and ethical considerations.\n\n## Explore more\n\n## AI Lifecycle Management Building AI Agents You Can Trust at Every Stage\n\nWhat makes ai lifecycle management essential?

They are equipped with the ability to comprehend and generate natural language and perform diverse tasks.\n\nLLMs develop these capabilities through extensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training, learning statistical patterns from text documents. One of their key applications is text generation, a type of generative AI in which they predict subsequent tokens or words based on input text.\n\nLLMs are neural networks, with the most advanced models as of March 2024 employing a decoder-only transformer-based architecture. Some recent variations also utilize other architectures like recurrent neural networks or Mamba (a state space model). While various techniques have been explored for natural language tasks, LLMs rely exclusively on deep learning methodologies. They excel in capturing intricate relationships between entities within the text and can generate text by leveraging the semantic and syntactic nuances of the language.\n\n### **How do they work?**\n\nLLMs operate using advanced deep learning techniques, primarily based on transformer architectures such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Transformers are well-suited for handling sequential data like text input, as they can effectively capture long-range dependencies and context within the data. LLMs consist of multiple layers of neural networks, each containing adjustable parameters that are optimized during the training process.\n\nDuring training, LLMs learn to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context provided by preceding words. This prediction is achieved by assigning probability scores to tokenized words, which are segments of text broken down into smaller sequences of characters. These tokens are then transformed into embeddings, which are numeric representations encoding contextual information about the text.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and robustness, LLMs are trained on vast text corpora, often comprising billions of pages of data. This extensive training corpus allows the model to learn grammar, semantics, and conceptual relationships through zero-shot and self-supervised learning approaches. LLMs become proficient in understanding and generating language patterns by processing large volumes of text data.\n\nOnce trained, LLMs can autonomously generate text by predicting the next word or sequence of words based on their input. The model leverages the patterns and knowledge acquired during training to produce coherent and contextually relevant language. This capability enables LLMs to perform various natural language understanding and content generation tasks.\n\nLLM performance can be further improved through various techniques such as prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with human feedback. These strategies help refine the model’s responses and mitigate issues like biases or incorrect answers that can arise from training on large, unstructured datasets. By continuously optimizing the model’s parameters and training processes, LLMs can achieve higher levels of accuracy and reliability.\n\nRigorous validation processes are essential to ensure that LLMs are suitable for enterprise-level applications without posing risks such as liability or reputational damage. These include thorough testing, validation against diverse datasets, and adherence to ethical guidelines. By addressing potential biases and ensuring robust performance, LLMs can be deployed effectively in real-world scenarios, supporting a variety of language-related tasks with high accuracy and efficiency.\n\n## LLMs: The foundation, technical features and key development considerations and challenges\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cornerstone in the advancement of artificial intelligence, transforming our interaction with technology and our ability to process and generate human language.

This learning process is what empowers LLMs to perform a wide array of language-related tasks with remarkable accuracy.\n\n### **Key technical features of LLMs**\n\n* **Attention mechanisms**: One of the defining features of [transformer-based models](https://www.leewayhertz.com/generative-ai-models/) like LLMs is their use of attention mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the models to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, enabling them to focus on relevant information and ignore the rest. This ability is crucial for understanding the context and nuances of language.\n* **Contextual word representations**: Unlike earlier language models that treated words in isolation, LLMs generate contextual word representations. This means that the representation of a word can change depending on its context, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of language.\n* **Scalability**: LLMs are designed to scale with the amount of data available. As they are fed more data, their ability to understand and generate language improves. This scalability is a key factor in their success and continued development.\n\n### **Challenges and considerations in LLM development**\n\nDespite their impressive capabilities, the development of LLMs is not without challenges:\n\n* **Computational resources**: Training LLMs requires significant computational resources due to the size of the models and the volume of data involved. This can make it difficult for smaller organizations to leverage the full potential of LLMs.\n* **Data quality and bias**: The quality of the training data is crucial for the performance of LLMs. Biases in the data can lead to biased outputs, raising ethical and fairness concerns.\n* **Interpretability**: As LLMs become more complex, understanding how they make decisions becomes more challenging. Ensuring interpretability and transparency in LLMs is an ongoing area of research.\n\nIn conclusion, LLMs represent a significant leap forward in the field of artificial intelligence, driven by their advanced technical features, such as attention mechanisms and contextual word representations.

Below is a detailed guide on how to select the most suitable language model for your NLP applications:\n\n### **1. Define your use case and requirements**\n\nThe first step in choosing the right LLM is to understand your use case and its requirements clearly. Are you building a conversational AI system, a text summarization tool, or a sentiment analysis application? Each use case has unique demands, such as the need for open-ended generation, concise summarization, or precise sentiment classification.\n\nAdditionally, consider factors like the desired level of performance, the required inference speed, and the computational resources available for training and deployment. Some LLMs excel in specific areas but may be resource-intensive, while others offer a balance between performance and efficiency.\n\n### **2. Understand LLM pre-training objectives**\n\nLLMs are pre-trained on vast datasets using different objectives, which significantly influence their capabilities and performance characteristics. The three main pre-training objectives are:\n\na. **Autoregressive language modeling:** Models are trained to predict the next token in a sequence, making them well-suited for open-ended text generation tasks such as creative writing, conversational AI, and question-answering.\n\nb. **Auto-encoding:** Models are trained to reconstruct masked tokens based on their context, excelling in natural language understanding tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction.\n\nc. **Sequence-to-sequence transduction:** Models are trained to transform input sequences into output sequences, making them suitable for tasks like machine translation, summarization, and data-to-text generation.\n\nAlign your use case with the appropriate pre-training objective to narrow down your LLM options.\n\n### **3. Evaluate model performance and benchmarks**\n\nOnce you have identified a shortlist of LLMs based on their pre-training objectives, evaluate their performance on relevant benchmarks and datasets. Many LLM papers report results on standard NLP benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and BIG-bench, which can provide a good starting point for comparison.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that these benchmarks may not fully represent your specific use case or domain. Whenever possible, test the shortlisted LLMs on a representative subset of your own data to get a more accurate assessment of their real-world performance.\n\n### **4. Consider model size and computational requirements**\n\nLLMs come in different sizes, ranging from millions to billions of parameters. While larger models generally perform better, they also require significantly more computational resources for training and inference.\n\nEvaluate the trade-off between model size and computational requirements based on your available resources and infrastructure. If you have limited resources, you may need to consider smaller or distilled models, which can still provide decent performance while being more computationally efficient.\n\n### **5. Explore fine-tuning and deployment options**\n\nMost LLMs are pre-trained on broad datasets and require fine-tuning on task-specific data to achieve optimal performance. Fine-tuning can be done through traditional transfer learning techniques or through few-shot or zero-shot learning, where the model is prompted with task descriptions and a few examples during inference.\n\nConsider the trade-offs between these approaches. Fine-tuning typically yields better performance but requires more effort and resources, while few-shot or zero-shot learning is more convenient but may sacrifice accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, evaluate the deployment options for the LLM. Some models are available through cloud APIs, which can be convenient for rapid prototyping but may introduce dependencies and ongoing costs. Self-hosting the LLM can provide more control and flexibility but requires more engineering effort and infrastructure.\n\n### **6. Stay up-to-date with the latest developments**\n\nThe LLM landscape is rapidly evolving, with new models and techniques being introduced frequently. Regularly monitor academic publications, industry blogs, and developer communities to stay informed about the latest developments and potential performance improvements.\n\nEstablish a process for periodically re-evaluating your LLM choice, as a newer model or technique may better align with your evolving use case requirements.\n\nChoosing the right LLM for your NLP use case is a multifaceted process that requires careful consideration of various factors. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can navigate the LLM landscape more effectively, make an informed decision, and ensure that you leverage the most suitable language model to power your NLP applications successfully.\n\n## Evaluating large language models: A comprehensive guide to ensuring performance, accuracy, and reliability\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in AI, powering a wide range of applications from chatbots and content creation to AI copilots and advanced recommendation systems. As these models play increasingly critical roles in various industries, evaluating their performance, accuracy, and efficiency becomes essential. LLM evaluation is the process of assessing these models to ensure they meet the high standards necessary for their diverse applications.\n\n### **What is LLM evaluation?**\n\nLLM evaluation is a comprehensive process designed to assess the capabilities and performance of large language models. This process is essential for understanding how well an LLM performs various language-related tasks, such as generating coherent text, answering questions, and processing natural language inputs. By rigorously evaluating these models, developers and researchers can identify strengths, address limitations, and refine models to better meet specific needs and applications.\n\n### **Why is LLM evaluation important?**\n\nThe rapid adoption of LLMs across various industries, such as healthcare, finance, and customer service, has made it crucial to evaluate these models regularly. Without proper evaluation, LLMs may produce inaccurate, biased, or even harmful outputs, leading to unsatisfactory user experiences and potentially damaging outcomes. Therefore, LLM evaluation not only helps in enhancing the models\' performance but also in ensuring their safe and ethical deployment in real-world scenarios.\n\n### **Key LLM evaluation metrics**\n\nEvaluating LLMs involves using various metrics to gauge different aspects of performance:\n\n* **Relevance**: Measures how well the LLM\'s responses match the user\'s query. This is crucial for applications where accurate information retrieval is essential.\n* **Hallucination**: Assesses the model\'s tendency to generate incorrect or illogical information. Reducing hallucinations improves the reliability of LLM outputs.\n* **Question-answering accuracy**: Evaluates how effectively the model handles direct inquiries, which is important for tasks requiring precise answers.\n* **Toxicity**: Ensures that the LLM’s outputs are free from harmful or offensive content, which is vital for public-facing applications.\n* **Bleu score**: Used primarily in translation tasks, this metric evaluates how closely the machine-generated text aligns with reference translations.\n* **Rouge score**: Measures the quality of summaries by comparing them with reference texts, useful for summarization tasks.\n\n### **Context-specific evaluation**\n\nDifferent applications require different evaluation criteria. For instance, in educational settings, it’s crucial to assess the age-appropriateness and factual accuracy of the LLM’s responses. In customer service applications, the focus might be on the relevance and coherence of the model\'s interactions. The context in which an LLM is deployed plays a significant role in determining the appropriate evaluation metrics.\n\n### **Advanced evaluation techniques**\n\nBeyond these standard metrics, advanced tools and frameworks like OpenAI’s Eval library and Hugging Face’s evaluation platforms provide developers with the means to conduct more nuanced assessments. These tools allow for comparative analysis, helping to fine-tune LLMs for specific applications and ensuring that they meet the desired standards of performance.\n\n### **Evaluation templates**\n\nDifferent evaluation templates help tailor assessments to specific needs:\n\n* **General template**: Offers a standardized framework for evaluating overall performance and accuracy using common NLP metrics.\n* **TruthfulQA template**: Focuses on evaluating the truthfulness of responses to avoid generating false information.\n* **LLM-as-a-judge template**: Utilizes one LLM to evaluate the outputs of another, providing a comparative analysis of response quality.\n\n### **Comparative analysis in LLM performance evaluation**\n\nComparative analysis is an essential component of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), offering insights into their effectiveness and areas for improvement. This process involves examining various performance indicators, considering user feedback, and assessing the integration and impact of LLM embeddings. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs, comparative analysis helps enhance user trust and align AI solutions more closely with user needs.\n\n#### **Essential performance indicators for comparative analysis**\n\nEffective comparative analysis relies on various performance indicators and metrics, each serving a specific purpose in evaluating LLM performance:\n\n* **Accuracy (Task success rate):** Measures the model’s ability to produce correct responses to prompts. This metric is crucial for understanding how well an LLM performs its intended tasks, providing a baseline for its effectiveness.\n* **Fluency (Perplexity):** Assesses the natural flow and readability of the text generated by the LLM. Low perplexity indicates smoother, more coherent text, which is essential for creating engaging and understandable content.\n* **Relevance (ROUGE scores):** Evaluates content relevance and alignment with user input. ROUGE scores are particularly useful for tasks such as summarization and translation, ensuring the output is closely aligned with the input and context.\n* **Bias (Disparity analysis):** Identifies and mitigates biases within model responses. By analyzing disparities, developers can address ethical concerns and work towards more balanced and fair AI interactions.\n* **Coherence (Coh-Metrix):** Analyzes logical consistency and clarity over longer stretches of text. This metric is important for evaluating the coherence of generated content, ensuring that it maintains a logical flow and is easily understood.\n\n#### **Integrating comparative analysis with LLM evaluation**\n\nThe comparative analysis goes beyond simple performance metrics by considering:\n\n* **Model evolution:** Tracking how different LLMs improve over time in response to updates and refinements.\n* **Hands-on user feedback:** Gathering insights from users to gauge practical performance and satisfaction.\n* **Embedding integration:** Evaluating how well LLM embeddings contribute to the overall performance and relevance of the model’s outputs.\n\nBy thoroughly examining these aspects, comparative analysis helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various LLMs. This approach not only enhances user trust but also aligns AI solutions more closely with specific needs and values.\n\n### **Model evaluation vs. system evaluation**\n\nIt is important to distinguish between LLM model evaluation and LLM system evaluation.

Below is a detailed guide on how to select the most suitable language model for your NLP applications:\n\n### **1. Define your use case and requirements**\n\nThe first step in choosing the right LLM is to understand your use case and its requirements clearly. Are you building a conversational AI system, a text summarization tool, or a sentiment analysis application? Each use case has unique demands, such as the need for open-ended generation, concise summarization, or precise sentiment classification.\n\nAdditionally, consider factors like the desired level of performance, the required inference speed, and the computational resources available for training and deployment. Some LLMs excel in specific areas but may be resource-intensive, while others offer a balance between performance and efficiency.\n\n### **2. Understand LLM pre-training objectives**\n\nLLMs are pre-trained on vast datasets using different objectives, which significantly influence their capabilities and performance characteristics. The three main pre-training objectives are:\n\na. **Autoregressive language modeling:** Models are trained to predict the next token in a sequence, making them well-suited for open-ended text generation tasks such as creative writing, conversational AI, and question-answering.\n\nb. **Auto-encoding:** Models are trained to reconstruct masked tokens based on their context, excelling in natural language understanding tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, and relation extraction.\n\nc. **Sequence-to-sequence transduction:** Models are trained to transform input sequences into output sequences, making them suitable for tasks like machine translation, summarization, and data-to-text generation.\n\nAlign your use case with the appropriate pre-training objective to narrow down your LLM options.\n\n### **3. Evaluate model performance and benchmarks**\n\nOnce you have identified a shortlist of LLMs based on their pre-training objectives, evaluate their performance on relevant benchmarks and datasets. Many LLM papers report results on standard NLP benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and BIG-bench, which can provide a good starting point for comparison.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that these benchmarks may not fully represent your specific use case or domain. Whenever possible, test the shortlisted LLMs on a representative subset of your own data to get a more accurate assessment of their real-world performance.\n\n### **4. Consider model size and computational requirements**\n\nLLMs come in different sizes, ranging from millions to billions of parameters. While larger models generally perform better, they also require significantly more computational resources for training and inference.\n\nEvaluate the trade-off between model size and computational requirements based on your available resources and infrastructure. If you have limited resources, you may need to consider smaller or distilled models, which can still provide decent performance while being more computationally efficient.\n\n### **5. Explore fine-tuning and deployment options**\n\nMost LLMs are pre-trained on broad datasets and require fine-tuning on task-specific data to achieve optimal performance. Fine-tuning can be done through traditional transfer learning techniques or through few-shot or zero-shot learning, where the model is prompted with task descriptions and a few examples during inference.\n\nConsider the trade-offs between these approaches. Fine-tuning typically yields better performance but requires more effort and resources, while few-shot or zero-shot learning is more convenient but may sacrifice accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, evaluate the deployment options for the LLM. Some models are available through cloud APIs, which can be convenient for rapid prototyping but may introduce dependencies and ongoing costs. Self-hosting the LLM can provide more control and flexibility but requires more engineering effort and infrastructure.\n\n### **6. Stay up-to-date with the latest developments**\n\nThe LLM landscape is rapidly evolving, with new models and techniques being introduced frequently. Regularly monitor academic publications, industry blogs, and developer communities to stay informed about the latest developments and potential performance improvements.\n\nEstablish a process for periodically re-evaluating your LLM choice, as a newer model or technique may better align with your evolving use case requirements.\n\nChoosing the right LLM for your NLP use case is a multifaceted process that requires careful consideration of various factors. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can navigate the LLM landscape more effectively, make an informed decision, and ensure that you leverage the most suitable language model to power your NLP applications successfully.\n\n## Evaluating large language models: A comprehensive guide to ensuring performance, accuracy, and reliability\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in AI, powering a wide range of applications from chatbots and content creation to AI copilots and advanced recommendation systems. As these models play increasingly critical roles in various industries, evaluating their performance, accuracy, and efficiency becomes essential. LLM evaluation is the process of assessing these models to ensure they meet the high standards necessary for their diverse applications.\n\n### **What is LLM evaluation?**\n\nLLM evaluation is a comprehensive process designed to assess the capabilities and performance of large language models. This process is essential for understanding how well an LLM performs various language-related tasks, such as generating coherent text, answering questions, and processing natural language inputs. By rigorously evaluating these models, developers and researchers can identify strengths, address limitations, and refine models to better meet specific needs and applications.\n\n### **Why is LLM evaluation important?**\n\nThe rapid adoption of LLMs across various industries, such as healthcare, finance, and customer service, has made it crucial to evaluate these models regularly. Without proper evaluation, LLMs may produce inaccurate, biased, or even harmful outputs, leading to unsatisfactory user experiences and potentially damaging outcomes. Therefore, LLM evaluation not only helps in enhancing the models’ performance but also in ensuring their safe and ethical deployment in real-world scenarios.\n\n### **Key LLM evaluation metrics**\n\nEvaluating LLMs involves using various metrics to gauge different aspects of performance:\n\n* **Relevance**: Measures how well the LLM’s responses match the user’s query. This is crucial for applications where accurate information retrieval is essential.\n* **Hallucination**: Assesses the model’s tendency to generate incorrect or illogical information. Reducing hallucinations improves the reliability of LLM outputs.\n* **Question-answering accuracy**: Evaluates how effectively the model handles direct inquiries, which is important for tasks requiring precise answers.\n* **Toxicity**: Ensures that the LLM’s outputs are free from harmful or offensive content, which is vital for public-facing applications.\n* **Bleu score**: Used primarily in translation tasks, this metric evaluates how closely the machine-generated text aligns with reference translations.\n* **Rouge score**: Measures the quality of summaries by comparing them with reference texts, useful for summarization tasks.\n\n### **Context-specific evaluation**\n\nDifferent applications require different evaluation criteria. For instance, in educational settings, it’s crucial to assess the age-appropriateness and factual accuracy of the LLM’s responses. In customer service applications, the focus might be on the relevance and coherence of the model’s interactions. The context in which an LLM is deployed plays a significant role in determining the appropriate evaluation metrics.\n\n### **Advanced evaluation techniques**\n\nBeyond these standard metrics, advanced tools and frameworks like OpenAI’s Eval library and Hugging Face’s evaluation platforms provide developers with the means to conduct more nuanced assessments. These tools allow for comparative analysis, helping to fine-tune LLMs for specific applications and ensuring that they meet the desired standards of performance.\n\n### **Evaluation templates**\n\nDifferent evaluation templates help tailor assessments to specific needs:\n\n* **General template**: Offers a standardized framework for evaluating overall performance and accuracy using common NLP metrics.\n* **TruthfulQA template**: Focuses on evaluating the truthfulness of responses to avoid generating false information.\n* **LLM-as-a-judge template**: Utilizes one LLM to evaluate the outputs of another, providing a comparative analysis of response quality.\n\n### **Comparative analysis in LLM performance evaluation**\n\nComparative analysis is an essential component of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), offering insights into their effectiveness and areas for improvement. This process involves examining various performance indicators, considering user feedback, and assessing the integration and impact of LLM embeddings. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs, comparative analysis helps enhance user trust and align AI solutions more closely with user needs.\n\n#### **Essential performance indicators for comparative analysis**\n\nEffective comparative analysis relies on various performance indicators and metrics, each serving a specific purpose in evaluating LLM performance:\n\n* **Accuracy (Task success rate):** Measures the model’s ability to produce correct responses to prompts. This metric is crucial for understanding how well an LLM performs its intended tasks, providing a baseline for its effectiveness.\n* **Fluency (Perplexity):** Assesses the natural flow and readability of the text generated by the LLM. Low perplexity indicates smoother, more coherent text, which is essential for creating engaging and understandable content.\n* **Relevance (ROUGE scores):** Evaluates content relevance and alignment with user input. ROUGE scores are particularly useful for tasks such as summarization and translation, ensuring the output is closely aligned with the input and context.\n* **Bias (Disparity analysis):** Identifies and mitigates biases within model responses. By analyzing disparities, developers can address ethical concerns and work towards more balanced and fair AI interactions.\n* **Coherence (Coh-Metrix):** Analyzes logical consistency and clarity over longer stretches of text. This metric is important for evaluating the coherence of generated content, ensuring that it maintains a logical flow and is easily understood.\n\n#### **Integrating comparative analysis with LLM evaluation**\n\nThe comparative analysis goes beyond simple performance metrics by considering:\n\n* **Model evolution:** Tracking how different LLMs improve over time in response to updates and refinements.\n* **Hands-on user feedback:** Gathering insights from users to gauge practical performance and satisfaction.\n* **Embedding integration:** Evaluating how well LLM embeddings contribute to the overall performance and relevance of the model’s outputs.\n\nBy thoroughly examining these aspects, comparative analysis helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various LLMs. This approach not only enhances user trust but also aligns AI solutions more closely with specific needs and values.\n\n### **Model evaluation vs. system evaluation**\n\nIt is important to distinguish between LLM model evaluation and LLM system evaluation. Model evaluation focuses on assessing the raw capabilities of the model itself, measuring its intelligence, adaptability, and ability to perform across a range of tasks. System evaluation, on the other hand, examines how the model performs within a specific application or framework, taking into account the integration of prompts, contexts, and other components that influence the user experience.\n\nUnderstanding the differences between these two types of evaluations is essential for developers and practitioners. While model evaluation informs the foundational development of LLMs, system evaluation focuses on optimizing the user experience and ensuring that the model performs effectively in its intended context.\n\n### **Best practices for evaluating LLMs**\n\nTo achieve accurate and insightful evaluations, consider these best practices:\n\n* **Leverage LLMOps**: Utilize tools and frameworks for orchestrating and automating LLM workflows to maintain consistency and avoid biases.\n* **Employ multiple metrics**: Use a variety of metrics to cover different aspects of LLM performance, including fluency, coherence, and contextual understanding.\n* **Real-world testing**: Validate LLMs in practical scenarios to ensure their effectiveness and adaptability beyond controlled environments.\n\nEvaluating large language models (LLMs) is a critical step in the development and deployment of AI systems. By carefully assessing their performance, accuracy, and efficiency, developers and researchers can ensure that these powerful tools are reliable, effective, and aligned with their users’ specific needs. As LLMs continue to evolve, robust evaluation frameworks will be essential in guiding their development and maximizing their potential across various industries.\n\n## Endnote\n\nThe field of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly evolving, with new models emerging at an impressive pace. Each LLM boasts its own strengths and weaknesses, making the choice for a particular application crucial. Open-source models offer transparency, customization, and cost-efficiency, while closed-source models may provide superior performance and access to advanced research.\n\nAs we move forward, it’s important to consider not just technical capabilities but also factors like safety, bias, and real-world impact.

Some of the most popular benchmarking datasets are:\n\n* **MMLU-Pro** refines the MMLU dataset by offering ten choices per question, requiring more reasoning and reducing noise through expert review.[2](#easy-footnote-bottom-2-68488 "https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro")\n* **GPQA** features challenging questions designed by domain experts, validated for difficulty and factuality, and is accessible only through gating mechanisms to prevent contamination.[3](#easy-footnote-bottom-3-68488 "https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa")\n* **MuSR** consists of algorithmically generated complex problems, requiring models to use reasoning and long-range context parsing, with few models performing better than random.[4](#easy-footnote-bottom-4-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/TAUR-Lab/MuSR")\n* **MATH** is a compilation of difficult high-school-level competition problems, formatted for consistency, focusing on the hardest questions.[5](#easy-footnote-bottom-5-68488 "https://github.com/hendrycks/math")\n* **IFEval** tests models’ ability to follow explicit instructions and formatting using strict metrics for evaluation.[6](#easy-footnote-bottom-6-68488 "https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/tasks/ifeval/README.md")\n* **BBH** includes 23 challenging tasks from the BigBench dataset, measuring objective metrics and language understanding, and correlates well with human preference.[7](#easy-footnote-bottom-7-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukaemon/bbh")\n* **HumanEval** evaluates the performance of an LLM in code generation, focusing particularly on its functional correctness.[8](#easy-footnote-bottom-8-68488 "https://github.com/openai/human-eval")\n* **TruthfulQA**\xa0addresses hallucination problems by measuring an LLM’s ability to generate true answers.[9](#easy-footnote-bottom-9-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/domenicrosati/TruthfulQA")\n* **General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)** and **SuperGLUE** test the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly for language-understanding tasks.[10](#easy-footnote-bottom-10-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue")\n\nKey research takeaways also include the need for better benchmarking, collaboration, and innovation to push the boundaries of LLM capabilities.\n\n### 2. Dataset preparation\n\nUsing either custom-made or open-source datasets is acceptable. The key point is that the dataset should be recent enough so that the LLMs have not yet been trained on it.\n\nCurated [datasets](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-data/),\xa0including [training](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-training/), validation, and test sets, are prepared for each benchmark task. These datasets should be large enough to capture\xa0variations in language use, domain-specific nuances, and potential biases. Careful data curation is essential to ensure high-quality and unbiased evaluation.\n\n### 3. Model training and fine-tuning\n\nModels trained as [large language models (LLMs)](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-training/) undergo [fine-tuning](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-fine-tuning/#why-or-when-does-your-business-need-a-fine-tuned-llm) to improve task-specific performance. The process typically begins with pre-training on large text sources like Wikipedia or the Common Crawl, allowing the model to learn language patterns and structures, forming the base for generative AI coding and generating human-like text.\n\nAfter pre-training, LLMs are fine-tuned on specific benchmark datasets to enhance [performance](https://research.aimultiple.com/how-to-measure-ai-performance/) in tasks like translation or summarization. These models vary in size, from small to large, and use transformer-based designs. Alternative training methods are often employed to boost their capabilities.\n\n### 4. Model evaluation\n\nThe trained or fine-tuned LLM models are evaluated on the benchmark tasks using the predefined evaluation metrics. The models’ performance is measured based on their ability to generate accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate responses for each task. The evaluation results provide insights into the LLM models’ strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance.\n\n### 5. Comparative analysis\n\nThe evaluation results are analyzed to compare the performance of different LLM models on each benchmark task. Models are ranked based on their overall performance or task-specific metrics. Comparative analysis allows researchers and practitioners to identify state-of-the-art models, track progress over time, and understand the relative strengths of different models for specific tasks.\n\nFigure 1: Top 10 ranking of different Large Language Models based on their performance metrics.[11](#easy-footnote-bottom-11-68488 "https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/")\n\n## Evaluation metrics\n\nChoosing a benchmarking method and evaluation metrics to define the overall evaluation criteria based on the model’s intended use are almost simultaneous tasks. Numerous metrics are used for evaluation.\n\nThese particular quantitative or qualitative measurement methods evaluate certain facets of LLM performance. With differing degrees of connection to human assessments, they offer numerical or categorical scores that may be monitored over time and compared between models.\n\n### [General performance metrics](https://research.aimultiple.com/machine-learning-accuracy/)\n\n* **Accuracy** is the percentage of correct responses in binary tasks.\n* **Recall** is the actual number of true positives versus false ones in LLM responses.\n* **F1 score** blends accuracy and recall into one metric. F1 scores range from 0–1, with 1 signifying excellent recall and precision.\n* **Latency is the** model’s efficiency and speed.\n* **Toxicity** shows the immunity of the model to harmful or offensive content in the outputs.\n* **Elo ratings for AI models** rank language models based on competitive performance in shared tasks, similar to how chess players are ranked. Models compete by generating outputs for the same tasks, and ratings are adjusted as new models or tasks are introduced.\n\n### Text-specific metrics\n\n* **Coherence** is the score of the logical flow and consistency of the generated text.\n* **Diversity** measures assess the variety and uniqueness of the generated responses. It involves analyzing metrics such as n-gram diversity or measuring the semantic similarity between generated responses. Higher diversity scores indicate more diverse and unique outputs.\n* **Perplexity** is a measure used to evaluate the performance of language models. It quantifies how well the model predicts a sample of text. Lower perplexity values indicate better performance.\n\nFigure 2: Examples of perplexity evaluation.\n\n* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** is a metric used in machine translation tasks. It compares the generated output with one or more reference translations and measures their similarity.\xa0BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better performance.\n\n* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gissing Evaluation)** is a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries. It compares the generated summary with one or more reference summaries and calculates precision, recall, and F1 scores (Figure 3). ROUGE scores provide insights into the language model’s summary generation capabilities.\n\nFigure 3: An example of a ROUGE evaluation process.[12](#easy-footnote-bottom-12-68488 "https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-text-summarization-with-rouge-scores-84140c64b471/")\n\nEvaluation metrics can be judged by a model or a human. Both have their own advantages and use cases:\n\n### LLM evaluating LLMs\n\nThe LLM assesses the caliber of its own products in an examination known as LLM-as-a-judge. This could involve comparing model-generated text to ground-truth data or measuring outcomes with statistical metrics like accuracy and F1.\n\nLLM-as-a-judge provides businesses with high efficiency by quickly assessing millions of outputs at a fraction of the expense of human review. It is suitable for large-scale deployments where speed and resource optimization are crucial success factors because it is adequate at evaluating technical content in situations where qualified reviewers are hard to come by, allows for continuous quality monitoring of AI systems, and produces repeatable results that hold true throughout evaluation cycles.\n\n### Human-in-the-loop evaluation\n\nThe evaluation process includes enlisting human evaluators who assess the language model’s output quality. These evaluators rate the generated responses based on different criteria: relevance, fluency, coherence, and overall quality.\xa0This approach offers subjective feedback on the model’s performance.\n\nHuman evaluation is still crucial for high-stakes enterprise applications where mistakes could cause serious harm to the company’s operations or reputation. Human reviewers are excellent at identifying subtle problems with cultural context, ethical implications, and practical usefulness that automated systems frequently overlook. They also meet regulatory requirements for human oversight in sensitive industries such as healthcare, finance, and legal services.\n\n## LLM evaluation tools & frameworks\n\nLLM evaluation can be performed in two ways: you can conduct it yourself using either open-source or commercial frameworks or pre-calculated values from benchmarks or results from open-source frameworks of the base models.\n\n### Open-source frameworks\n\n#### Comprehensive evaluation frameworks\n\nComprehensive evaluation frameworks are integrated systems that provide a variety of metrics and evaluation techniques in a unified testing environment. They usually offer defined benchmarks, test suites, and reporting systems to evaluate LLMs across a range of capabilities and dimensions.\n\n* **LEval (Language Model Evaluation)** is a framework for evaluating LLMs on long-context understanding.[13](#easy-footnote-bottom-13-68488 "https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LEval")  LEval is a benchmark suite featuring 411 questions across eight tasks, with contexts from 5,000 to 200,000 tokens. It evaluates how well models perform information retrieval and reasoning with lengthy documents. The suite includes tasks like academic summarization, technical document generation, and multi-turn dialogue coherence, allowing researchers to test models on practical applications rather than isolated linguistic tasks.\n* **Prometheus** is an open-source framework that uses LLMs as judges with systematic prompting strategies.[14](#easy-footnote-bottom-14-68488 "https://huggingface.co/prometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0")  It’s designed to produce evaluation scores that align with human preferences and judgment.\n\n#### Testing approaches\n\nTesting approaches are methodological techniques for organizing and carrying out assessments that are not dependent on particular metrics or instruments. They specify experimental designs, sample techniques, and testing philosophies that can be applied with different frameworks.\n\n* **DAG (Deep Acyclic Graph)** evaluation workflows use directed acyclic graphs to represent evaluation pipelines, though it’s not a specific evaluation tool.\n* **Dynamic prompt testing** evaluates models by exposing them to evolving, real-world scenarios that mimic user interaction. This method evaluates how models respond to complex, multi-layered queries & ambiguous prompts.\n* **The energy and hardware efficiency benchmark** framework measures the energy consumption and computational efficiency of models during training and inference. It focuses on sustainability metrics, such as carbon emissions and power usage.\n\n### Commercial evaluation platforms\n\nCommercial evaluation platforms are vendor-provided solutions with compliance features, MLOps pipeline integration, and user-friendly interfaces that are intended for enterprise use cases. They frequently have monitoring capabilities and strike a compromise between technical depth and non-technical stakeholders’ accessibility.\n\n* **DeepEval (Confident AI)** is a developer-focused testing framework that helps evaluate LLM applications using predefined metrics for accuracy, bias, and performance. It interfaces with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.\n* **Azure AI Studio Evaluation (Microsoft)** offers built-in evaluation tools for comparing different models and prompts, with automatic metric tracking and human feedback collection capabilities.\n* **Prompt Flow (Microsoft)** is a development tool for building, evaluating, and deploying LLM applications. Its built-in evaluation capabilities allow for systematic testing across models and prompts.\n* **LangSmith (LangChain)** is a platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring LLM applications, with features for comparing models and tracing execution paths.\n* **TruLens (TruEra)** is an open-source toolkit for evaluating and explaining LLM applications, with features for tracking hallucinations, relevance, and groundedness.\n* **Vertex AI Studio (Google)** provides tools to test and evaluate model outputs, with both automatic metrics and human evaluation capabilities within Google’s AI ecosystem.\n* **Amazon Bedrock** includes evaluation capabilities for foundation models, allowing developers to test and compare different models before deployment.\n* **Parea AI** is a platform for evaluating and monitoring LLM applications with a specific focus on data quality and model performance.\n\n### Pre-evaluated benchmarks\n\nPre-evaluated benchmarks provide valuable insights using specific metrics, making them particularly useful for metric-driven analysis. Our website features benchmarks for leading models, helping you assess performance effectively. Key benchmarks include:\n\n* [**Hallucination**](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-hallucination/) – Evaluates the accuracy and factual consistency of generated content.\n* [**AI Coding**](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-code/) – Measures coding ability, correctness, and execution.\n* [**AI Reasoning**](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-reasoning/) – Assesses logical inference and problem-solving capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the **OpenLLM Leaderboard** offers a live benchmarking system that evaluates models on publicly available datasets. It aggregates scores from tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering, providing a dynamic and up-to-date comparison of model performance.\n\n## Evaluation use cases\n\n### 1. Performance assessment\n\nConsider an enterprise that needs to choose between multiple models for its base [enterprise generative model](https://research.aimultiple.com/enterprise-generative-ai/). These LLMs must be evaluated to assess how well they generate text and respond to input. Performance assessment metrics can include **accuracy**, **fluency**, **coherence**, and **subject relevance**.\n\nWith the advent of [large multimodal models](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-multimodal-models/), enterprises can also evaluate models that process and generate multiple data types, such as **[images](https://research.aimultiple.com/image-recognition-vs-classification/)**, **text**, and **[audio](https://research.aimultiple.com/audio-data-collection/)**, expanding the scope and capabilities of [generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-services/).\n\n### 2. Model comparison\n\nAn enterprise may have fine-tuned a model for higher performance in tasks specific to its industry. An evaluation framework helps researchers and practitioners compare LLMs and measure progress, helping them select the most appropriate model for a given application. LLM evaluation’s ability to pinpoint areas for development and opportunities to address deficiencies might result in a better user experience, fewer risks, and even a possible competitive advantage.\n\n### 3. Bias detection and mitigation\n\nLLMs can [have biases](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-bias/) in their training data, which may lead to the spread of misinformation, representing one of the [risks associated with generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/risks-of-generative-ai/). A comprehensive evaluation framework helps identify and measure biases in LLM outputs, allowing researchers to develop strategies for bias detection and mitigation.\n\n### 4. User satisfaction and trust\n\nEvaluation of user satisfaction and trust is crucial to test generative language models. Relevance, coherence, and diversity are evaluated to ensure that models match user expectations and inspire trust. This assessment framework aids in understanding the level of user satisfaction and trust in the responses generated by the models.\n\n### 5. Evaluation of RAG systems\n\nLLM evaluation can be used to assess the quality of answers generated by [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://research.aimultiple.com/retrieval-augmented-generation/) systems. Various datasets can be utilized to verify the accuracy of the answers.\n\n## What are the common challenges with existing LLM evaluation methods?\n\nWhile existing evaluation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) provide valuable insights, they are imperfect. The common issues associated with them are:\n\n### Overfitting\n\nScale AI found that some LLMs are overfitting on popular AI benchmarks. They created GSM1k, a smaller version of the GSM8k benchmark for math testing. LLMs performed worse on GSM1k than on GSM8k, indicating a lack of genuine understanding. These findings suggest that current AI evaluation methods may be misleading due to overfitting, underscoring the need for additional testing methods, such as GSM1k.\n\n### Lack of diverse metrics\n\nThe evaluation techniques used for LLMs today frequently do not capture the whole range of output diversity and innovation. The crucial significance of producing diverse and creative replies is sometimes overlooked by traditional metrics emphasizing accuracy and relevance. Research on the problem of assessing diversity in LLM results is still ongoing. Although perplexity gauges a model’s ability to anticipate text, it ignores crucial elements like coherence, contextual awareness, and relevance. Therefore, depending only on ambiguity could not offer a thorough evaluation of an LLM’s actual quality.\n\n### Subjectivity & high cost of human evaluations\n\nHuman evaluation is a valuable method for assessing the outputs of large language models (LLMs). However, it can be subjective, biased, and significantly more expensive than automated evaluations. Different human evaluators may have varying opinions, and the criteria for evaluation may lack consistency. Furthermore, human evaluation can be time-consuming and costly, especially for large-scale assessments. Evaluators often disagree when assessing subjective aspects, such as helpfulness or creativity, making it challenging to establish a reliable ground truth for evaluation.\n\n### Biases in automated evaluations\n\nLLM evaluations suffer from predictable biases. We provided one example for each bias, but the opposite cases are also possible (e.g., some models can favor last items).\n\n* **Order bias**: First items favored.\n* **Compassion fade**: Names are favored vs. anonymized code words\n* **Ego bias**: Similar responses are favored\n* **Salience bias**: Longer responses are preferred\n* **Bandwagon effect**: Majority belief is preferred\n* **Attention bias**: Sharing more irrelevant information is preferred\n\n### Limited reference data\n\nSome evaluation methods, such as BLEU or ROUGE, require reference data for comparison.\xa0However, obtaining high-quality reference data can be challenging, especially when multiple acceptable responses exist or in open-ended tasks. Limited or biased reference data may not capture the full range of acceptable model outputs.\n\n### Generalization to real-world scenarios\n\nEvaluation methods typically focus on specific benchmark datasets or tasks that don’t fully reflect the challenges of real-world applications. The evaluation of controlled datasets may not generalize well to diverse and dynamic contexts where LLMs are deployed.\n\n### Adversarial attacks\n\nLLMs can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, such as manipulating model predictions and data poisoning, where carefully crafted input can mislead or deceive the model. Existing evaluation methods often do not account for such attacks, and robustness evaluation remains an active area of research.\n\nIn addition to these issues, [enterprise generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/enterprise-generative-ai/) models may struggle with [legal](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-legal/) and [ethical](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-ethics/) issues, which may affect LLMs in your business.\n\n### Complexity and cost of multi-dimensional evaluation\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) must be evaluated on various dimensions, such as factual accuracy, toxicity, and bias. This often involves trade-offs, making it challenging to develop unified scoring systems. A thorough evaluation of these models across multiple dimensions and datasets demands substantial computational resources, which can limit access for smaller organizations.\n\n## Best practices to overcome problems of LLM evaluation methods\n\nResearchers and practitioners are exploring various approaches and strategies to address the problems with large language models’ performance evaluation methods. It may be prohibitively expensive to leverage all of these approaches in every project, but awareness of these best practices can improve LLM project success.\n\n### Known training data\n\nLeverage foundation models that share their training data to prevent contamination.\n\n### Multiple evaluation metrics\n\nInstead of relying solely on perplexity, incorporate multiple evaluation metrics for a more comprehensive assessment of LLM performance. Metrics like\xa0these can better capture the different aspects of model quality:\n\n* Fluency\n* Coherence\n* Relevance\n* Diversity\n* Context understanding\n\n### Enhanced human evaluation\n\nClear guidelines and standardized criteria can improve the consistency and objectivity of human evaluation. Using multiple human judges and conducting inter-rater reliability checks can help reduce subjectivity. Additionally, crowd-sourcing evaluation can provide diverse perspectives and larger-scale assessments.\n\n### Diverse reference data\n\nCreate diverse and representative reference data to better evaluate LLM outputs. Curating datasets that cover a wide range of acceptable responses, encouraging contributions from diverse sources, and considering various contexts can enhance the quality and coverage of reference data.\n\n### Incorporating multiple metrics\n\nEncourage the generation of diverse responses and evaluate the uniqueness of generated text through methods such as n-gram diversity or semantic similarity measurements.\n\n### Real-world evaluation\n\n[Augmenting](https://research.aimultiple.com/data-augmentation-techniques/) evaluation methods with real-world scenarios and tasks can improve the generalization of LLM performance. Employing domain-specific or industry-specific evaluation datasets can provide a more realistic assessment of model capabilities.\n\n### Robustness evaluation\n\nEvaluating LLMs for robustness against adversarial attacks is an ongoing research area. Developing evaluation methods that test the model’s resilience to various adversarial inputs and scenarios can enhance the security and reliability of LLMs.\n\n### Leverage LLMOps\n\n[LLMOps](https://research.aimultiple.com/llmops-tools/), a specialized branch of [MLOps](https://research.aimultiple.com/mlops-tools/), is dedicated to developing and enhancing LLMs. Employing for testing and customizing LLMs in your business not only saves time but also minimizes errors.\n\n## Practical examples of LLM evaluation\n\nSeveral organizations have shared their practical experiences with LLM evaluation:\n\n## Ethical considerations in LLM evaluation\n\nWhile performance metrics and benchmarking are crucial, enterprises must also consider the [ethical](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-ethics/) implications of LLM evaluation. These include:\n\n* **Fairness:** Models may produce biased outputs that reflect systemic issues in their training data. Evaluation frameworks should measure bias across demographics, contexts, and applications.\n* **Transparency:** Clearly documenting datasets, evaluation criteria, and model limitations increases trust and accountability.\n* **Accountability:** Enterprises deploying LLMs must ensure that their evaluation processes align with relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in [healthcare](https://research.aimultiple.com/healthcare-ai/), [finance](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-finance/), and [government](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-government/) sectors.\n* **[Responsible](https://research.aimultiple.com/responsible-ai/) deployment:** Evaluations should measure not only accuracy but also social impact, safety, and misuse potential. This can include red-teaming and adversarial testing to expose risks.\n\nBy incorporating ethical considerations into evaluation frameworks, organizations can mitigate reputational risks, ensure compliance, and foster trust with users.\n\n## Latest trends in LLM evaluation\n\nResearch in LLM evaluation is evolving rapidly. Some notable trends include:\n\n* **Multimodal evaluation:** As models expand beyond text into images, audio, and video, evaluation frameworks are being extended to test multimodal understanding and generation.\n* **Dynamic benchmark creation:** Instead of static datasets that models may overfit, researchers are developing adaptive benchmarks that evolve (e.g., auto-generated, domain-specific test suites).\n* **LLM-as-a-judge 2.0:** Improved prompting strategies and chain-of-thought evaluations are enabling more reliable automated evaluations that better align with human judgments.\n* **Energy-aware benchmarking:** [Sustainability](https://research.aimultiple.com/sustainability-ai/)-focused benchmarks that evaluate carbon cost and energy efficiency are gaining traction.\n* **Red-teaming frameworks:** Systematic adversarial testing is becoming an integral part of evaluation pipelines, enabling the measurement of robustness against manipulation and unsafe behaviors.\n\n## What do leading researchers think about evals?\n\nTrust is eroding in evaluations that are no longer capable of accurately evaluating model performance:\n\n## Glossary of key terms\n\nFor readers new to the space, here’s a quick reference to essential evaluation metrics:\n\n* **Perplexity:** A measure of how well the model predicts text; lower is better.\n* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Measures overlap between machine translations and human translations.\n* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Compares machine-generated summaries against human-written references.\n* **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct outputs versus all outputs.\n* **Recall:** Ability to retrieve relevant results out of all possible correct ones.\n* **F1 score:** Harmonic mean of accuracy and recall.\n* **Coherence:** Logical flow and consistency of generated text.\n* **Diversity:** Uniqueness and variability of model outputs, often measured with n-grams or semantic similarity.\n* **Elo rating:** A competitive ranking system adapted from chess to compare models head-to-head.\n\n## 💡Conclusion\n\nEvaluating large language models is crucial throughout their entire lifecycle, encompassing selection, fine-tuning, and secure, dependable deployment. As the capabilities of LLMs increase, it becomes inadequate to depend solely on a single metric (like perplexity) or benchmark. Thus, a multidimensional strategy that integrates automated scores (e.g., BLEU/ROUGE, checks for factual consistency), structured human evaluations (with specific guidelines and inter-rater agreement), and custom tests for bias, fairness, and toxicity is vital to assess both quantitative performance and qualitative risks.\n\nYet significant challenges remain. Public benchmarks can lead to overfitting on well-trodden datasets, while human-in-the-loop evaluations are time-consuming and complicated to scale. Adversarial inputs expose robustness gaps, and energy-intensive models raise sustainability concerns. Addressing these requires curating diverse, domain-specific test suites; integrating red-team and adversarial stress-testing; deploying LLM-as-judge pipelines for rapid, cost-effective assessment; and tracking energy and inference costs alongside accuracy metrics.\n\nBy embedding these best practices within an LLMOps framework, organizations can maintain a robust, ongoing view of model behavior in production. This holistic evaluation strategy mitigates risks like bias, hallucination, and security vulnerabilities and ensures that LLMs deliver trustworthy, high-impact outcomes as they evolve.\n\n## FAQ\n\n## Further reading\n\nLearn more on ChatGPT to understand LLMs better by reading:\n\n* [AI Transformation: 6 Real-Life Strategies to Succeed](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-transformation/)\n* [ChatGPT Education Use Cases, Benefits & Challenges](https://research.aimultiple.com/chatgpt-education/)\n* [How to Use ChatGPT for Business: Top 40 Applications](https://research.aimultiple.com/chatgpt-for-business/)\n* [GPT-5: In-depth Guide](https://research.aimultiple.com/gpt-5/)\n\n## Reference Links\n\n[1.\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard - a Hugging Face Space by open-llm-leaderboard\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/)[2.\n\nGitHub - TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro: The code and data for "MMLU-Pro: A More Robust and Challenging Multi-Task Language Understanding Benchmark" [NeurIPS 2024]](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro)[3.\n\nGitHub - idavidrein/gpqa: GPQA: A Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark](https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa)[4.\n\nTAUR-Lab/MuSR · Datasets at Hugging Face\n\nTAUR Lab at UT Austin](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TAUR-Lab/MuSR)[5.\n\nGitHub - hendrycks/math: The MATH Dataset (NeurIPS 2021)](https://github.com/hendrycks/math)[6.\n\nlm-evaluation-harness/lm\\_eval/tasks/ifeval/README.md at main · EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness · GitHub](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/tasks/ifeval/README.md)[7.\n\nlukaemon/bbh · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukaemon/bbh)[8.\n\nGitHub - openai/human-eval: Code for the paper "Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code"](https://github.com/openai/human-eval)[9.\n\ndomenicrosati/TruthfulQA · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/domenicrosati/TruthfulQA)[10.\n\naps/super\\_glue · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue)[11.\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard - a Hugging Face Space by open-llm-leaderboard\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/)[12.\n\nIntroduction to Text Summarization with ROUGE Scores | Towards Data Science\n\nTowards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-text-summarization-with-rouge-scores-84140c64b471/)[13.\n\nGitHub - OpenLMLab/LEval: [ACL\'24 Outstanding] Data and code for L-Eval, a comprehensive long context language models evaluation benchmark](https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LEval)[14.\n\nprometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0 · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/prometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0)\n\nPrincipal Analyst\n\nCem Dilmegani\n\nPrincipal Analyst\n\n[Follow On](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cem-dilmegani/ "Follow on")\n\nCem has been the principal analyst at AIMultiple since 2017.

With the number of LLMs continuing to grow, organizations face increasing uncertainty when choosing the right model for their needs. This article explains the process and key factors to consider when comparing LLMs, as well as some best practices for added efficiency.\n\n**Summary of key factors to consider in LLM comparison**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n| **Concept** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Use case compatibility | LLMs differ in their ability to reason and understand domains, as well as in their effectiveness when used in conjunction with various architectural patterns. |\n| LLM effectiveness | Use factors such as output relevance, faithfulness, and bias to compare the effectiveness of LLMs. View the LLM outputs side by side for your use case. |\n| Deployment mechanism | Some LLMs offer the ability to be deployed privately within an organization’s internal network. Others are available only on the cloud. |\n| Cost | The cost of using LLMs is represented in terms of the number of input and output tokens, particularly in cloud deployments. For on-premise deployments, this is expressed in terms of infrastructure requirements. |\n| Response times | Some LLMs are inherently faster than others for specific tasks, and response time for your use case is a key comparison factor. Some cloud-based LLMs have throttling limits that cannot be removed, even in the highest-tier account. |\n| Context window | The context window of an LLM is the number of tokens that can be fed as input to it. This includes the original user prompt and any additional information that the LLM may require. |\n| Compliance adherence | LLMs vary in their policies regarding aspects such as privacy, geopolitical considerations, and the use of organizational data for training, among others. |\n\n**What is LLM comparison?**\n---------------------------\n\nLLM comparison is the systematic process of evaluating multiple large language models against one another to determine which best aligns with an organization’s strategic goals. Beyond mere technical curiosity, this exercise has a direct business impact: selecting the optimal model.\n\n*   Reduces operational costs\n*   Accelerates time-to-market as the LLM quickly delivers what your project needs\n*   Improves risk management by identifying models that minimize hallucinations or bias.\n*   Strengthens compliance by surfacing data‑handling differences.\n*   Increases ROI by aligning model capabilities to revenue‑critical tasks.\n\nIn practice, comparing LLMs involves running the same inputs through different APIs or self‑hosted instances, collecting outputs, and scoring them on dimensions such as accuracy, latency, and safety. However, the real value lies in tying those scores back to your business objectives—ensuring that the model you select isn’t just the “best” on a benchmark, but the one that drives the greatest value for your users and your bottom line.\n\n[Nexla](https://nexla.com/) provides a user-friendly environment for enabling side-by-side comparison of LLM outputs. Engineers can access the platform through its intuitive point-and-click user interface or leverage the Nexla Orchestrated Versatile Agent (NOVA), an agent interface familiar with natural language requests.\n\n**Challenges in LLM comparison**\n--------------------------------\n\nHowever, the LLM comparison process presents some challenges, ranging from the sheer number of them competing for your attention to the lack of universal benchmarks. The following section details the typical challenges faced while evaluating LLMs.\n\n### **Large number of LLMs**\n\nMany LLMs exist today, ranging from open-source models to closed-source ones. Each of these models has different strengths (e.g., reasoning vs. creativity) and computational requirements\u200b. This sheer variety makes it hard to even know which ones to test.\n\n### **Unpredictable LLM performance**\n\nLLMs perform best at tasks they are tuned for. A model that performs well in one domain may fail in another. In other words, everything should be focused on the use case. For instance, a finance-specialized model may outperform a general-purpose model on regulatory documents, even if its raw benchmark score is lower.\n\n### **Lack of output consistency**\n\nLLM outputs can be non-deterministic and vary with prompt phrasing, random seeds, or subtle context changes\u200b. This inconsistency means one-off comparisons can be misleading. Teams often have to run multiple tests or use statistical measures of consistency to get a reliable comparison.\n\n### **Lack of universal benchmarks**\n\nNo metric can be designed to cover the full spectrum of characteristics that define LLM performance. While standardized measures like BLEU and ROUGE are commonly used for tasks such as summarization or machine translation, they are based on exact word-overlap similarity, which is inappropriate for evaluating LLMs.\n\nLLMs can generate semantically equivalent responses in differing vocabulary, wording, or structure, yielding unrealistically low scores despite reasonable output. The majority of the key dimensions of assessment, like factual accuracy, coherence, bias, and safety, require a nuanced, subjective determination that can’t be provided by automated measures alone.\n\n### **Costs add up**\n\nLarger models require more GPU time for each test, and if testing many models across thousands of prompts, the compute cost adds up. This is especially true when models have large context windows or require a large number of generated tokens. Thus, enterprises must budget resources just to compare models.\n\n**Factors to consider while comparing LLMs**\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWhen evaluating LLMs for enterprise use, one must consider multiple dimensions of performance and integration.\n\n![Image 60](https://nexla.com/n3x_ctx/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)\n\nFactors to consider while comparing LLMs\n\n### **Use case compatibility**\n\nSome LLMs are trained on broad internet data for general purposes. In contrast, others are further fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks, e.g, fine-tuned on legal, medical, or corporate data through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\u200b. A general model like GPT-4 may have broad knowledge, but a domain-tuned LLM can outperform it on specialized tasks. [For example](https://arya.ai/blog/generic-vs-domain-specific-llms), Llama2 or BloombergGPT (trained on financial texts) answered finance queries more accurately than a general model.\n\nThe table below presents examples of real-world use cases and compatible top models\n\n| **Use case** | **Top models** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Conversational AI & customer support | GPT 5, Claude 3.7, Llama 3.1/3.3 |\n| Code generation & technical reasoning | DeepSeekR1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Qwen 2.5 |\n| Content creation & creative writing | GPT 5, Llama 3.3, Gemini 2.5 Pro |\n| Research & academic use | DeepSeekR1, Falcon 180B, Llama 3.3 |\n\n### **LLM effectiveness**\n\nKey things to remember when analysing the effectiveness of LLM output include:\n\n#### **Relevance**\n\nLLM output may be correct but irrelevant if it is not aligned with the user’s intent. Check for relevance by experimentation with varied prompts or human relevance annotation.\n\n#### **Hallucinations**\n\nMetrics like the Hallucination Index measure the degree to which models fabricate information in the output\u200b. You must cross-validate outputs against ground truth, especially for fact-based questions.\n\n#### **Bias**\n\nBoth general and fine-tuned LLMs can produce biased and offensive responses because they are trained on unchecked or imbalanced data. Use fairness benchmarks and toxicity filters. Test your LLMs on demographic test sets or use bias-detection tools like DeepEval or LLM Guard.\n\n### **Cost**\n\nLLM cost comes in several forms:\n\n#### **Inference cost**\n\nMost cloud APIs charge per token (input + output). This means longer prompts and responses directly increase your bill. According to one analysis, using GPT-4 can be significantly more expensive than a similar open-source model for tasks such as summarization. Keep in mind that prices change rapidly; newer models often drop costs each year.\n\n#### **Hardware cost**\n\nRunning LLMs on your GPUs has a high upfront cost. A powerful server with many GPUs can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Operational expenses, such as electricity and cooling, add up too. However, if you have stable, high-volume usage, on-premises can be more cost-effective in the long term. A [Dell study](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-in/solutions/business-solutions/industry-market/esg-inferencing-on-premises-with-dell-technologies-analyst-paper.pdf) found that on-premises infrastructures could be 1.6–4 times more cost-effective than cloud IaaS for large-scale LLM inference.\n\n#### **Model fine-tuning**\n\nIf you plan to fine-tune the model on your data, factor in training costs, which can be comparable to serving costs. Large models require more computing power to retrain; this can easily cost in the low tens of thousands of dollars for a single pass.\n\n#### **Context length impact**\n\nLonger context windows also raise the cost. Every additional token in the input or output requires computational cost. The more input and output you have, the more you pay. Using retrieval (RAG) can help by keeping inputs shorter.\n\nIn practice, compare the total cost of ownership. For token-based pricing, estimate costs with your expected usage. For self-hosting, calculate hardware amortization. Often, a mixed strategy works: prototype on a cloud API to control initial expenses, then, if usage is high, move to a self-hosted setup to reduce marginal costs.\n\nThe table below shows the inference cost of some top LLMs\n\n| **Model** | **Provider** | **Context Window** | **Open Source** | **Input Cost/1M token** | **Output cost/1M token** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| gpt-4.1 | OpenAI | 1M | No | $2 | $8 |\n| gpt-4o | OpenAI | 128K | No | $2.5 | $10 |\n| o1 | OpenAI | 200K | No | $15 | $60 |\n| o3 | OpenAI | 200K | No | $1.10 | $4.40 |\n| Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Anthropic | 200K | No | $3 | $15 |\n| Claude 3.5 Haiku | Anthropic | 200K | No | $0.8 | $4 |\n| Claude 3 Opus | Anthropic | 200K | No | $15 | $75 |\n| Gemini 2.0 Flash | Google | 1M | No | $0.10 | $0.40 |\n| Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite | Google | 1M | No | $0.075 | $0.30 |\n| grok-3-beta | XAI | 131072 | Yes | $3 | $15 |\n| grok-3-fast-beta | XAI | 131072 | Yes | $5 | $25 |\n| Mistral Large 24.11 | Mistral | 131K | Yes | $2 | $6 |\n| Mistral 8B 24.10 | Mistral | 131K | Yes | $0.1 | $0.1 |\n| DeepSeek-V3 | DeepSeek | 64K | Yes | $0.27 | $1.10 |\n| DeepSeek-R1 | DeepSeek | 64K | Yes | $0.55 | $2.19 |\n\n![Image 62](https://nexla.com/n3x_ctx/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)\n\n### Powering data engineering automation for AI and ML applications\n\n[Learn More](https://nexla.com/generative-ai/)\n\n*   \n![Image 64](https://nexla.com/n3x_ctx/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)\n\n Enhance LLM models like GPT and LaMDA with your own data \n*   \n![Image 66](https://nexla.com/n3x_ctx/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)\n\n Connect to any vector database like Pinecone \n*   \n![Image 68](https://nexla.com/n3x_ctx/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)\n\n Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines with no code \n\n### **Response times**\n\nThe speed of generating output is critical in real-time applications. Some of the factors affecting the response time for LLMs include:\n\n#### **Model size**\n\nLarger models require more time to generate each token. Research shows that doubling model parameters does _not_ halve the speed, but larger LLMs are notably slower. According to [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/blog/llm-inference-performance-engineering-best-practices), a 30B model was approximately 2.5 times slower per token than a 7B model on the same hardware. In other words, a smaller model or a distilled version may be preferable if latency is a critical concern.\n\n#### **Batching & concurrency**\n\nIf you serve many users concurrently, you can trade per-query speed for throughput by batching requests. However, large batch sizes can increase the average latency per user. Tune batch sizes according to your workload (the model’s throughput often improves with batching, but time per response can rise).\n\n#### **API rate limits**\n\nCloud providers impose rate limits (requests per minute and tokens per minute). For example, OpenAI enforces token-per-minute quotas on each model. If you hit these limits, your service will slow down. Always check the specific rate limits and plan for retries or back-offs.\n\n#### **Geographic latency**\n\nIf using a cloud API, the physical distance to the server can add network delay. Some providers (like Azure OpenAI) allow region selection. For global applications, consider multi-region deployments or on-prem solutions closer to users.\n\n### **Context window**\n\nThe context window is the size of the tokens the model can process at once. A larger context window enables the model to utilize more context (e.g., entire documents) in a single pass, which can enhance answers in long-document tasks. However, the computation cost grows quadratically with sequence length\u200b, because attention must consider all token pairs. In practice, doubling the context often results in more than a doubling of inference time. Additionally, very large context LLMs require more GPU RAM. If on-premises, ensure that the hardware can handle the maximum context of your chosen model.\n\n### **Compliance adherence**\n\nThere are various regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA/CPRA, that establish guidelines on how LLMs can use personal and sensitive data. Choosing between cloud services and on-premise options requires careful consideration of where the data will be stored. It is also crucial to closely examine LLM provider policies regarding data usage. This includes how they train their models and what agreements they have in place for processing data or providing reports on how data is handled.\n\n### **Deployment mechanism**\n\nMany cutting-edge LLMs (like OpenAI’s GPT series, Anthropic Claude, Google PaLM) are only available via cloud APIs. This simplifies setup, but it means that all data goes through the vendor’s systems. On-premises or private-cloud deployment, using an open-source model or a cloud vendor’s managed offering, provides more control over data and security.\n\nOn-prem solutions offer higher control, security, and cost advantages at scale, while cloud solutions provide faster startup and lower initial investment. If data privacy or IP protection is vital, open-source LLMs (such as Llama, Mistral, and Falcon) can be hosted on your own infrastructure. This requires GPU servers but avoids vendor lock-in. Some businesses use hybrid approaches (fine-tuning an open model on-premises, then deploying via a private API).\n\nWhen it comes to scaling, self-hosted (open-source LLMs) allow you to scale hardware as needed, but building that pipeline requires effort. Cloud APIs typically guarantee uptime and can handle large loads with adequate subscription tiers, but may have rate limits. Ensure the deployment option meets your expected query volume and availability requirements.\n\n### **LLM benchmark data sets**\n\nGeneral LLM benchmarks serve as a good starting point for a model’s comprehension. However, they are insufficient to provide a comprehensive assessment for a single real-world application. This deficiency has led to the creation of use-case-specific benchmark datasets.\n\nThese tailored datasets enable a fine-grained assessment of LLM performance against the precise needs and expectations of an individual application. For example, [Evidently AI](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-evaluation-benchmarks-datasets) provides 200 publicly available domain-specific LLM benchmarks and evaluation datasets.\n\n| **Feature** | **General LLM Benchmarks** | **Use-Case Specific Evaluation** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Scope | Broad | Narrow |\n| Relevance to specific applications | Maybe limited | High |\n| Coverage of edge cases | Often lacking | Can be tailored |\n| Metrics alignment | May not align with specific application goals | Aligned with specific application goals |\n| Business metrics assessment | Typically not assessed (e.g., cost, speed, safety) | Often included (e.g., cost, speed, safety, domain-specific KPIs) |\n\nCustom gold reference datasets are higher-quality, carefully hand-labeled datasets specifically designed for testing LLM performance. Serving as the “ground truth,” these datasets are used as a benchmark against which the accuracy and correctness of LLM outputs can be rigorously tested.\n\nEvaluation with use-case specific and custom gold reference test datasets focuses on the specific inputs, tasks, and scenarios of the intended application, providing a more accurate and meaningful assessment of the LLM’s real-world performance.\n\n#### **Advantages**\n\nAdvantages include:\n\n*   **Identification of domain-specific strengths and weaknesses** — Datasets can be designed to probe specific areas relevant to the use case, revealing granular insights into where the LLM excels and where it needs improvement within a particular domain.\n*   **Subjectivity and nuance** — Datasets allow for context-aware judgments by human experts, aligning with desired outcomes, ethical standards, and safety requirements.\n*   **Evaluation-driven development (EDD)**— Datasets provide clear benchmarks for measuring the impact of changes and improvements, guiding iterative refinement of the LLM.\n*   **Better alignment with business goals and user expectations** — Datasets enable direct performance measurement on metrics that are most important for achieving business objectives and meeting user needs.\n\n### Unlock the Power of Data Integration. Nexla\'s Interactive Demo. No Email Required!\n\n[Tour the Product](https://nexla.com/interactive-demo/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=dataintegrationguide)\n\n#### **Limitations**\n\n**Over‑fitting to benchmarks is rampant.** Once a dataset is published, it often becomes part of subsequent model training corpora, enabling models to memorize or exploit statistical quirks rather than genuinely improve underlying capabilities. This effect means that high benchmark scores can be misleading, as models learn to excel on the test rather than the task as a whole.\n\nThe relevance of benchmark tasks to real-world applications is frequently weak. Many benchmarks lack rigorous justification for why their specific prompts accurately reflect practical needs, and users have reported that questions in standard suites (such as MMLU) often feel trivial or off-topic compared to domain-specific requirements.\n\n**Data contamination and quality control pose systemic risks**. Static benchmark datasets may be inadvertently copied into training data, and analyses show that benchmarks suffer from mislabeling vague questions and narrow coverage, which fail to sample the full diversity of real-world inputs.\n\nWhile newer benchmarks attempt dynamic question generation or domain‑expert questions, they still struggle with verifying that correct answers reflect true reasoning rather than superficial pattern-matching\n\n**No-code LLM comparison**\n--------------------------\n\nNo-code LLM comparison tools can be broadly classified into the following categories\n\n### **Vendor-specific consoles**\n\nVendor-specific consoles (e.g., AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI Studio, Hugging Face Eval) make it easy to test models within a single ecosystem, offering built-in metrics dashboards and simple UI prompts. However, they lock you into that vendor’s models and metrics, making cross-vendor comparisons cumbersome or impossible. You can’t, for example, run a GPT-4 vs. Claude side-by-side without stitching together two separate interfaces and manually reconciling results.\n\n### **Open-source frameworks**\n\nOpen-source frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Evals, Giskard) give you flexibility to connect to nearly any LLM API and define custom tests. However, they still require significant coding tasks, such as assembling pipelines, writing adapter logic, and building dashboards from scratch. Engineering teams frequently spend weeks gluing together evaluation scripts, data ingestion, and metric collection before they can even start comparing outputs.\n\n### **Low-code platforms**\n\nLow-code “universal” platforms (Cohere Command, Weaviate Hub) offer drag-and-drop workflows for RAG pipelines or model callers, but often focus solely on retrieval or embeddings, rather than full LLM evaluation. Their metrics tend to be limited to token usage and basic latency/throughput statistics, with little support for advanced quality checks (bias, factuality, coherence) or human-in-the-loop feedback loops.\n\n### **How Nexla closes the gaps**\n\nNexla provides an interface that allows for integrating multiple LLMs and comparing their output based on typical architectural patterns, such as RAG. Compared to other alternatives for LLM comparison, Nexla offers the following advantages.\n\n[Nexla](https://nexla.com/) combines true vendor neutrality, data integration, and comprehensive evaluation into a single, no-code environment. With over 20 pre-built LLM connectors (including GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek, GLM, Mistral, on-prem models, and more), you can orchestrate parallel calls to any combination of models in one pipeline—no SDKs, no manual API wrangling.\n\nNexla’s visual pipeline designer automatically handles data ingestion, prompt templating, and result collection, then surfaces side-by-side quality metrics (customizable to your domain) along with human review assignments. Rather than writing bespoke scripts to compare BLEU scores or token counts, you configure a Nexla pipeline that logs accuracy, hallucination rates, bias flags, and response times for every model at once.\n\nIf you need to switch from GPT-4 to Claude 2—or add a cutting-edge Chinese LLM—the change is a simple configuration update, not a code rewrite. By unifying data preparation, multi-model orchestration, automated metrics, and human feedback in a single, low-code platform, Nexla addresses the limitations of both closed and open evaluation tools, empowering enterprise teams to make rapid, evidence-based decisions about LLMs.\n\n**Best practices while comparing LLMs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n### **Prioritize use cases**\n\nStart any LLM evaluation by cataloging and prioritizing your specific tasks. Document the exact functions you want the model to perform (e.g., summarization, code generation, customer Q&A) and rank them by business importance.\n\nEvaluate candidate models by how well their documented capabilities match your highest-priority scenarios. For each use case, identify the key model qualities needed, such as reasoning depth, world knowledge, or language style, and score models against these.\n\nCreate a short “use case checklist” to guide all comparisons. For each LLM, run a few representative tasks early and see if its outputs meet your needs.\n\n### **Combine evaluation methods**\n\nUtilize a combination of automated metrics and human judgment to gain a comprehensive view.\n\nTeams should supplement standard benchmarks with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations: a separate LLM scores candidate outputs on dimensions such as relevance, coherence, and factuality, providing more context-sensitive and flexible assessments than rigid word-overlap metrics. Although “LLM‑as‑judge” methods are not perfect, they help capture nuanced qualities—such as fluency or adherence to style guidelines—that BLEU/ROUGE simply cannot measure.\n\nBy combining traditional benchmarks with LLM-as-a-judge and custom test sets, enterprises can mitigate benchmark limitations and gain a more comprehensive view of model performance.\n\n### **Evolve gold reference datasets**\n\nGeneric benchmarks are a start, but will always miss your domain’s nuances. Create a high-quality “gold” dataset for your use cases. For example, collecting real user queries, expert-written ideal responses, and complex examples is known to be problematic. These are your baselines by which all models are judged.\n\nA practical approach is to start with a synthetic baseline (i.e., auto-generated prompts) and then add in human-verified data. Use model-generated outputs to identify edge cases or blind spots, then correct or annotate those examples manually.\n\nPeriodically audit your reference set on a schedule. Add new templates and failure cases. Track coverage and ensure all key features or query types are covered.\n\nDiversity and recency are crucial: if your LLM integration adds new functionality or your customers ask new questions, update the gold references accordingly.\n\nAn evolving test set helps ensure that your evaluation pipeline remains relevant and that good performance on the golden dataset in offline evaluation highly correlates with user satisfaction. As a practical recommendation, version-control your gold data and treat it as part of the product – use it for regression testing when comparing models or tweaking prompts.\n\n### **Address compliance requirements**\n\nPre-deployment, enumerate the legal and regulatory constraints on your LLM application. Some sectors (healthcare, finance) are subject to strict regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI), and even general regulations (GDPR, CCPA) can be relevant. Failing to address data privacy legislation can result in significant fines and a loss of trust. Identify whether your data is sensitive (patient data, personal identifiers, etc.) or if outputs must conform to requirements (e.g., no prohibited content). Involve legal and compliance groups early to consider any compliance frameworks or certifications that may be required. This could involve creating an AI usage policy, securing Business Associate Agreements (for HIPAA) with providers, or strategizing how to manage data subject requests under GDPR in light of LLM logging practices.\n\nTake note of where the LLM processing will be done and what data the provider retains. If cross-border data transfer is forbidden by your compliance needs or if data deletion is required by law, you may need to self-host an open-source LLM or use a compliant cloud region.\n\nIf an on-premises deployment is necessary, prefer models that can be deployed on your premises. If cloud services are required, select providers that offer compliance guarantees. Enterprises operating in regulated industries must vet LLMs not only for capabilities but also for specific compliance requirements.\n\nFor example, the table below shows LLM requirements for HIPAA compliance.\n\n| **Requirement category** | **Minimum criteria for LLMs handling PHI under HIPAA** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Business associate agreement (BAA) | You must have a signed BAA with your LLM provider that explicitly covers PHI processing. This legal agreement obligates the vendor to maintain HIPAA-level safeguards and to report any breaches within the required timeframes. |\n| Data encryption and segregation | All PHI must be encrypted using FIPS-validated algorithms (e.g. AES-256) both when stored and while being sent to or from the LLM API. |\n| Isolated compute environments | The model inference must run in a dedicated virtual network or on-premises enclave so that PHI is never commingled with other customers’ data. |\n| Audit logging and traceability | Every API call that ingests PHI—and every generated response—must be logged with timestamps, user IDs, and the exact prompt used. Logs must be immutable and retained for a minimum of six years. |\n| Performance and safety thresholds | In medical summary or triage tasks, many organizations establish a minimum factual accuracy threshold of ≥ 95% on a representative PHI test set before LLM outputs can be used for any patient-facing or clinical decision support scenario. If more than 1% of audited responses contain hallucinations, the LLM is deemed unsuitable for PHI processing until retrained or constrained. |\n| De-identification and minimization | Before any PHI is sent to a third-party LLM, all direct identifiers (names, dates of birth, medical record numbers) must be removed or tokenized by the Safe Harbor method. |\n| Output restrictions | Ensure the LLM is not permitted to generate any new PHI—for example, by using strict system-level instructions that forbid creating or inferring identifiers. |\n\nNexla’s pipelines can enforce these controls via no-code settings: you simply toggle “HIPAA mode,” and the platform will\n\n*   Automatically strip or tokenize PHI fields before sending prompts,\n*   Route inference through a dedicated, BAA-certified endpoint (on-prem or in a compliant cloud region),\n*   Log every request and response in an immutable audit store, and\n*   Run real-time validation rules against outputs (e.g., medical-term verification) with configurable error thresholds.\n\nBy codifying these HIPAA-specific requirements into your data pipelines, Nexla ensures that deploying an LLM for healthcare use cases is not only technically feasible but also fully aligned with regulatory mandates, providing you with the confidence to transition from proof of concept to production in a compliant and auditable manner.\n\n### **Evaluate output consistency**\n\nLLM outputs are inherently nondeterministic, especially when sampling or high temperature is used. For applications that require reliability (e.g., legal advice, healthcare), variability can pose a significant risk.\n\nTest consistency by running the prompt multiple times at your chosen settings. If answers differ in accuracy or style, document that variance. Inconsistent responses can lead to confusion or a loss of trust in critical domains, such as healthcare. When deterministic output is required, you may need to set the temperature to a very low value or use deterministic decoding. Note that setting the temperature value to a smaller value improves consistency, but it affects creativity.\n\nUse parameters and prompt design to control consistency. If consistency is poor, consider ensemble checks (e.g., re-querying under multiple settings and voting).\n\n### **Consistent benchmarking**\n\nEnsure that every model you compare is evaluated under identical conditions. Use the same test prompts, datasets, and environment settings for all LLMs. By doing so, performance differences reflect the models themselves, not changes in the test.\n\nDocument every detail of your benchmark setup. Use containerized or scripted pipelines so that running the same tests later (or on a new model) is automated. By enforcing a consistent benchmarking methodology, you turn the comparison into a valid, apples-to-apples test rather than a series of one-off experiments.\n\n### Discover the Transformative Impact of Data Integration on GenAI\n\n[Watch Expert Panel](https://nexla.com/resource/genai-data-engineering-expert-panel/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=dataintegrationguide)\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nNo single LLM is best in all categories. Closed-source LLMs (like GPTs) excel at many tasks but have usage fees and data residency limitations. On the other hand, Open-source LLMs (like LLaMA) give flexibility and cost savings, but may require extra engineering and fine-tuning. Ultimately, the right choice depends on your use case, data, and constraints.\n\nTherefore, the key insight is to match model capabilities to your domain; continually evaluate on realistic tasks; and plan for scale and privacy. Ensure to use benchmarks and custom tests to understand weaknesses (hallucinations, latency). Architect your system to allow for easy swapping of models or the addition of more as needed. You should use tools like Nexla to automate data preparation and side-by-side model evaluation\u200b. With careful design and thorough testing, engineers can harness the immense power of LLMs while maintaining control over cost, compliance, and quality.\n\nNavigate Chapters:\n*   [Previous

Applications\n\n![](https://lsvp.com/wp-content/smush-webp/2023/11/PXL_20231113_190158034.PORTRAIT-scaled.jpeg.webp)\n\nAt our recent Generative London event, [Gemma Garriga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemmagarriga/), Technical Director, Office of the CTO, Google Cloud and [Meryem Arik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meryemarik/), Co-Founder of TitanML spoke with Antoine Moyroud, Partner at Lightspeed, to decode the intricacies of optimizing large language model (LLM) inference. As the buzz around deploying LLMs for real-world applications intensifies, the discussion shared valuable thoughts on quantization, fine-tuning, hardware choices, benchmarking challenges, and the ever-evolving landscape of model architectures.\n\nHere are four areas of AI technology the panel covered in their discussion:\n\n### Quantization Techniques\n\nThe panel dived into quantization techniques, exploring methods to slim down models without compromising accuracy. Meryem highlighted activation weight quantization ([AWQ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00978.pdf)) as a standout, capable of achieving substantial compression without sacrificing accuracy. Alongside, the discussion touched upon [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM), [VLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [Titan Takeoff Inference Server](https://www.titanml.co/), Google Cloud’s [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?hl=en), and its varying trade-offs, offering developers a view of these optimization techniques.\n\n### Fine-Tuning vs Prompting\n\nDrawing from practical examples, Gemma shed light on the efficacy of fine-tuning and prompting strategies. She shared real-life examples of leveraging fine-tuning and other techniques to successfully deliver\xa0 complex automated experiences, e.g. for a leading quick service restaurant in the USA. Gemma highlighted how fine tuning allows you to get more precise at specialised tasks with smaller models and better serving performance. Meryem’s work demonstrated how prompting techniques still excel in tasks like [knowledge injection](https://www.titanml.co/blog-post/boosting-llm-performance-low-effort-strategies-that-beat-fine-tuning) or generating specific outputs, notably JSON schemas. We discussed other existing solutions such as [Outlines](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines) or the latest OpenAI dev day announcements on [JSON mode](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday). Meryem also shared her thoughts on how we will see fine-tuning dying out as models get better and alternative techniques get better.\n\n### Optimizing Total Cost of Ownership\n\nBeyond shrinking model sizes, the conversation emphasized the broader spectrum of cost optimization. Shorter prompts, model pruning, and runtime tweaks emerged as additional avenues to reduce expenses. The importance of benchmarking on actual workloads rather than confined lab tests was emphasized. Gemma stressed the importance of striking the right balance between leveraging the latest open source technologies and considering total cost of ownership. She emphasized evaluating techniques against real-world enterprise use cases. Reducing cost of inference might end up increasing the total cost of ownership of a solution, and a smarter start to test product market fit is simply using managed APIs that already integrate in MLOps platforms.\n\n### Adapting to the Shifting Model Landscape\n\nAcknowledging the continued relevance of transformers, the panel stressed the evolving nature of model architectures. Encouraging developers to focus on real-world use cases, Meryem noted that models evolve rapidly, with transformers only emerging a few years ago unexpectedly. She pointed out we have not yet reached the limits of what can be achieved through increased compute and training on larger datasets. The panel agreed it is difficult to predict what the next major breakthrough may be. Companies must balance extracting value from today’s techniques while future-proofing their systems to some degree. As new architectures appear, lab benchmarks may also quickly become outdated, highlighting the importance of real-world use case evaluation.\n\nAs the generative AI journey unfolds, the emphasis remains on real-world optimization, marrying technical innovation with practical deployment. Continuous advancements in quantization, runtime optimization, and more pave the way for exciting prospects in deploying large language models at scale. The intent of the discussion was to provide a compass for developers and founders, directing their focus towards the pragmatic implementation of generative AI while keeping an eye on the latest developments.\n\nAuthors\n\n![Antoine Moyroud](https://lsvp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/antoinemoyroud-648860e6111df-150x150.webp)\n\nAntoine Moyroud\n\n![](https://lsvp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_mEsN73jGkFSh-CGlytbzeA@2x.jpg)\n\n### Sign up for our email list\n\n![](https://lsvp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/faction.webp)\n\nFaction Ventures, L.L.C.

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ["## Implications of Benchmark Results in Large Language Models\n\nBenchmark results play a pivotal role in assessing the performance and guiding the future development of large language models (LLMs). As these models have become integral to various applications, understanding the implications of benchmark scores is essential for evaluating their capabilities and ensuring their effective deployment across industries. This section delves into the significance of benchmark scores, their impact on model development, industry applications, and potential future directions in LLM benchmarking.\n\n### Understanding What Scores Mean\n\nBenchmark scores serve as quantitative measures of a model's performance on standardized tasks and datasets. They reflect a model's ability to understand and generate human-like text, as well as its proficiency in specific language-related tasks such as translation, summarization, and question-answering. Common metrics used in benchmarking include accuracy, F1 score, and perplexity, each providing insights into different facets of model performance.\n\nFor instance, accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model in classification tasks, while the F1 score balances precision and recall to provide a more nuanced view of performance, especially in imbalanced datasets. Perplexity, on the other hand, quantifies how well a probability distribution predicts a sample, with lower values indicating better performance. However, interpreting these scores requires careful consideration of the context in which they are derived, including the complexity of tasks and the representativeness of the datasets used. \n\nMoreover, benchmark scores can indicate a model’s generalization capabilities. A high score on a benchmark test does not guarantee that the model will perform well in real-world applications, particularly if the training data lacks diversity. This highlights the importance of scrutinizing not only the scores themselves but also the underlying data and methodologies employed in the benchmarking process.\n\n### Impact of Benchmarking on Model Development\n\nBenchmarking significantly influences LLM development by establishing performance standards and identifying areas needing improvement. By providing a standardized evaluation framework, benchmarks promote transparency and reproducibility in research, allowing for meaningful comparisons between different models. This competitive environment drives innovation, encouraging researchers to push the boundaries of what is possible in natural language processing.\n\nThe introduction of benchmarks such as GLUE and SuperGLUE has notably shaped the evolution of models like BERT and GPT-3. These benchmarks emphasized the importance of understanding context and transfer learning, while also establishing ambitious performance targets that subsequent models sought to exceed. The quest for higher benchmark scores has led to advancements in various methodologies, including fine-tuning, multitask learning, and the integration of external knowledge sources.\n\nHowever, the benchmarking process is not without challenges. Issues such as benchmark contamination—where test datasets overlap with training datasets—can inflate performance metrics and misrepresent a model’s true capabilities. This phenomenon can lead to misleading conclusions about a model's advancements, akin to students performing well on an exam after prior exposure to the test questions. To mitigate such risks, researchers are exploring solutions like embedding unique markers in test datasets to detect contamination, as well as developing dynamic benchmarks that adapt over time to prevent overfitting.\n\n### Industry Applications and Use Cases\n\nThe practical applications of LLMs are transforming various sectors, showcasing their potential to enhance efficiency and improve decision-making processes. In healthcare, LLMs are utilized for tasks such as automating medical documentation, enhancing patient interactions through chatbots, and assisting in diagnostic processes based on textual data from patient records. This automation allows healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care and less on administrative tasks.\n\nIn the finance sector, LLMs are employed for sentiment analysis to gauge market trends, automating customer inquiries, and generating reports based on complex financial data. Their ability to process and analyze large volumes of information rapidly makes them invaluable tools in environments requiring timely decision-making.\n\nAdditionally, in customer service, businesses leverage LLMs to create intelligent virtual assistants capable of understanding and responding to customer queries in real time. This capability improves customer satisfaction and reduces operational costs by streamlining support processes. The adaptability of LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific industry requirements further enhances their utility across various domains.\n\nAs industries increasingly adopt LLMs, the necessity for robust benchmarking frameworks that reflect real-world performance becomes paramount. Effective evaluation of these models not only ensures their reliability but also helps maintain trust in AI technologies.\n\n### Future Directions in LLM Benchmarking\n\nThe landscape of LLM benchmarking is evolving rapidly, driven by technological advancements and changing user expectations. As tasks grow more complex, future benchmarks are likely to incorporate a broader range of metrics that assess not only performance but also ethical considerations, bias, and interpretability. \n\nThere is a growing emphasis on evaluating models in diverse and challenging contexts. Future benchmarks may aim to test multilingual capabilities, robustness against adversarial inputs, and the ability to handle ambiguous or incomplete information. This shift will ensure that LLMs are not only powerful but also fair and reliable in their applications.\n\nMoreover, collaboration between academia and industry will be crucial in developing standardized benchmarks that accurately reflect real-world applications. Open-source frameworks and community-driven initiatives are expected to play a significant role in this process, fostering a shared understanding of best practices and driving innovation in benchmarking methodologies.\n\nAs the field of LLMs continues to grow, ongoing research into adaptive and dynamic benchmarking practices will be essential. This evolution will help ensure that advancements in AI are meaningful, reliable, and beneficial for society as a whole."], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='Implications of benchmark results in machine learning models'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/the-problem-with-benchmark-contamination-in-ai/', title='The Problem with Benchmark Contamination in AI - DeepLearning.AI', raw_content='[Start Learning](https://bit.ly/3RB9T8a)\n\n# Benchmark Tests Are Meaningless The problem with training data contamination in machine learning\n\n[Machine Learning Research](/the-batch/tag/research/)[Halloween](/the-batch/tag/halloween/)[Benchmarks](/the-batch/tag/benchmarks/)[Datasets](/the-batch/tag/datasets/)\n\nPublished\n\n[Oct 30, 2024](/the-batch/tag/oct-30-2024/)\n\nReading time\n\n2 min read\n\nLarge language models are trained on datasets scraped from the web, which includes pages that contain answers to common questions that are used to test the models.

Anything goes on the training set. Rank models on the test set. Let model builders compete. Call it a benchmark.\n\nMachine learning researchers cherish a good tradition of lamenting the apparent shortcomings of machine learning benchmarks. Critics argue that static test sets and metrics promote narrow research objectives, stifling more creative scientific pursuits. Benchmarks also incentivize gaming; in fact, Goodhart's law cautions against applying competitive pressure to statistical measurement. Over time, they say, researchers overfit to benchmarks, building models that exploit data artifacts. As a result, test set performance draws a skewed picture of model capabilities, deceiving us especially when comparing humans and machines. Top off the list of issues with a slew of reasons why things don't transfer from benchmarks to the real world.\n\nThese scorching critiques go hand in hand with serious ethical objections. Benchmarks reinforce and perpetuate biases in our representation of people, social relationships, culture, and society. Worse, the creation of massive human-annotated datasets extracts labor from a marginalized workforce disenfranchised from the economic gains their efforts enable.\n\nAll of this is true.\n\nMany have said it well. Many have argued it convincingly. I'm particularly drawn to the claim that benchmarks serve industry objectives, giving big tech labs a structural advantage. The case against benchmarks is clear, in my view.\n\nWhat's far less clear is the scientific case *for* benchmarks.\n\nThere is the undeniable fact that benchmarks have been successful as a driver of progress in the field. ImageNet was inseparable from the deep learning revolution ofthe 2010s, with companies competing fiercely over the best dog breed classifiers. The difference between a Blenheim Spaniel and a Welsh Springer became a matter of serious rivalry. A decade later, language model benchmarks reached geopolitical significance in the global competition over artificial intelligence. Tech CEOs now recite the company's number on MMLU—a set of 14,042 college-level multiple choice questions—in presentations to shareholders. I'm writing not longer after news broke that David beat Goliath on reasoning benchmarks, a sensation that shook global stock markets.\n\nBenchmarks come and go, but their centrality hasn't changed. Competitive leaderboard climbing has been the main way machine learning advances.\n\nIf we accept that progress in artificial intelligence is real, we must also accept that benchmarks have, in some sense, worked. But the fact that benchmarks worked is more of a hindsight observation than a scientific lesson. Benchmarks emerged in the early days of pattern recognition. They followed no scientific principles. To the extent that benchmarks had any theoretical support, that theory was readily invalidated by how people used benchmarks in practice. Statistics prescribed locking test sets in a vault, but machine learning practitioners did the opposite. They put them on the internet for everyone to use freely. Popular benchmarks draw millions of downloads and evaluations as model builders incrementally compete over better numbers.\n\nBenchmarks are the mistake that made machine learning. They shouldn't have worked and, yet, they did.\n\nBenchmarks emerged from little more than common sense and intuition. They appeared in the late 1950s, had some life during the 1960s, hibernated throughout the 1970s, and sprung to popularity in the late 1980s when pattern recognition became machine learning. Today, benchmarks are so ubiquitous, we take them for granted. And we expect them to do their job. After all, they have in the past.\n\nThe deep learning revolution of the 2010s was a triumph for the benchmarking enterprise. The ImageNet benchmark was at the center of all the cutting-edge advances in image classification with deep convolutional neural networks. Despite massive competitive pressure, it reliably supported model improvements for nearly a decade. Throughout its long life, a sprawling software ecosystem grew around ImageNet, making it ever simpler and faster to develop models on the benchmark.\n\nEven its tiny cousin, CIFAR-10, did surprisingly well for itself. Model builders often put CIFAR-10 into the development loop for architecture search. Once they found a promising candidate architecture, they would then scale it up to ImageNet. Folklorehas it that some of the best ImageNet architectures saw the light of day on CIFAR-10 first. Even though CIFAR-10 contains only tiny pixelated test images from ten classes, such as frogs, trucks, and ships, the dataset was any model builder's swiss army knife for many years. The platform PapersWithCode counts more than 15,000 papers published with CIFAR-10 evaluations. This does not count the numerous evaluations that went into every single one of these papers. It also doesn't count the enormous amount of engineering work that used the dataset in one way or the other.\n\nThat so much work should hinge on so little data might seem reckless.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, though, researchers verified that the ranking of popular models on CIFAR-10 largely agrees with the ranking of the same models on ImageNet. Model rankings on ImageNet in turn transfer well to many other datasets. The better a model is on ImageNet, the better it is elsewhere, too. Researchers even created a dataset called ImageNot, full of noisy web crawl data, designed to stray as far as possible from ImageNet, while matching only its size. Training all key ImageNet era architectures on ImageNot from scratch, model rankings turn out to be the same.\n\nModel rankings replicate to a surprising degree, which is in stark contrast with absolute performance numbers. Model accuracies and other metrics don't replicate from one dataset to the other, even when the datasets are similar. This means that model rankings—rather than model evaluations—are the primary scientific export of machine learning benchmarks.\n\nThe ImageNet era didn’t end with computer vision; it ended with natural language processing, as the new transformer architecture triumphed over the sluggish recurrent neural networks that had long been the workhorse for sequence problems of all kinds. Transformers were much easier to scale up and quickly took over. The simple training objective of next token prediction in a text sequence freed training data from human annotation. Companies quickly scraped up anything they could find on the internet, from chat messages and Reddit rants to humanity's finest writing. New scaling laws suggested that training loss decreases predictably as you jointly increase dataset size, number of model parameters, and training compute. For a while it seemed as though the only thing left to do was to sit back and watch new abilities emerge in explosively growing models. But where did this new reality leave benchmarks?\n\nThe new era departs from the old in some significant ways.\n\nFirst, models train on the internet, or at least massive minimally curated web crawls. At the point of evaluation, we therefore don't know and can't control what training data the model saw. This turns out to have profound implications for benchmarking. The extent to which a model has encountered data similar to the test task during training skews model comparisons and threatens the validity of model rankings. A worse model may have simply crammed better for the test. Would you prefer a worse student who came better prepared to the exam, or the better student who was less prepared? If it's the latter, you'll need to adjust for the difference in test preparation. Thankfully, this can be done by fine-tuning each model on the same task-specific data before evaluation without the need to train from scratch.\n\nSecond, models no longer solve a single task, but can be prompted to tackle pretty much any task. In response, multi-task benchmarks have emerged as the de-facto standard to provide a holistic evaluation of recent models by aggregating performance across numerous tasks into a single ranking. Aggregating rankings, however, is a thorny problem in social choice theory that has no perfect solution. Working from an analogy between multi-task benchmarks and voting systems, ideas from social choice theory reveal inherent trade-offs that muli-task benchmarks face. Specifically, greater task diversity necessarily comes at the cost of greater sensitivity to irrelevant changes. For example, adding weak models to popular multi-task benchmarks can change the order of top contenders. The familiar stability of model rankings, characteristic of the ImageNet era, therefore does not extend to multi-task benchmarks in the LLM era.\n\nThe final problem benchmarking faces is an existential one. As model capabilities exceed those of human evaluators, researchers are running out of ways to test new models. There's hope that models might be able to evaluate each other. But the idea of using models as judges runs into some serious hurdles. LLM judges are biased, unsurprisingly, in their own favor. Intriguing recent debiasing methods from statistics promise to debias model predictions from few human ground truth labels. Unfortunately, at the evaluation frontier—where new models are at least as good as the judge—even the optimal debiasing method is no better than collecting twice as many ground truth labels for evaluation.\n\nWill our old engine of progress grind to a halt?\n\nIn moments of crisis, we tend to accelerate. What if we instead step back and ask why we expected benchmarks to work in the first place—and for what purpose? This question leads us into uncharted territory. For the longest time, we took benchmarks for granted and didn’t bother to work out the underlying methodology. We got away with it mostly by sheer luck, but we might not be as lucky this time.\n\nOver the last decade, however, a growing body of work has begun to map out the foundations of a science of machine learning benchmarks. What emerges is a rich set of observations—both theoretical and empirical—raising intriguing open problems that deserve the community’s attention. If benchmarks are to serve us well in the future, we must put them on solid scientific ground. \xa0My upcoming book, The Emerging Science of Benchmarks, supports this development.\n\n## \n\n## Visit [mlbenchmarks.org](https://mlbenchmarks.org) to learn more.\n\n## References:\n\n* Salaudeen, O., & Hardt, M.

Dynamic frameworks and emerging trends drive robust, adaptive AI performance, ensuring safer, efficient deployment in sensitive fields like healthcare, finance, and law.\n\n#### [PremAI](/author/premai/)\n\n• 10 min read\n\nIn the dynamic field of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cornerstone of technological innovation, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across domains such as natural language understanding, reasoning, and creative text generation. The evaluation of these models has become increasingly critical, not just for understanding their performance but also for ensuring their safe deployment in real-world applications.\n\nThe evolution of LLM evaluation methodologies parallels the rapid advancements in their design. Early approaches relied on task-specific benchmarks like [GLUE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08073?ref=blog.premai.io) and [SuperGLUE](https://klu.ai/glossary/superglue-eval?ref=blog.premai.io) to assess isolated capabilities such as syntactic parsing and question answering. However, with the advent of models like [GPT-3](https://openai.com/index/gpt-3-apps/?ref=blog.premai.io), ChatGPT, and [GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/?ref=blog.premai.io), evaluation frameworks have expanded to accommodate complex, multi-faceted performance dimensions.\n\n[Key motivations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19736?ref=blog.premai.io) for evaluating LLMs include:\n\n1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Ensuring models meet task-specific requirements across diverse applications.\n2. **Safety and Trustworthiness**: Addressing concerns such as data privacy, toxicity, and misinformation to mitigate societal risks.\n3. **Alignment and Ethics**: Aligning model outputs with human values and minimizing biases.\n\nCurrent research underscores the importance of developing robust, adaptive evaluation frameworks that address these goals. The growing integration of LLMs into sensitive domains like healthcare, law, and finance further emphasizes the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluations.\n\n## **Objectives of LLM Evaluation**\n\nEvaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) serves multiple critical objectives, each essential for ensuring their effective deployment and integration into real-world systems. As these models are increasingly embedded in sensitive applications such as healthcare, law, and finance, rigorous evaluation becomes paramount. The key objectives of LLM evaluation include:\n\n#### **1. Performance Benchmarking**\n\n* **Definition**: Benchmarking aims to quantify an LLM's performance across diverse tasks, such as language understanding, reasoning, and generation.\n* **Examples**: Metrics like accuracy, perplexity, and F1 scores help evaluate language comprehension and fluency.\n* **Impact**: This enables developers to compare models, select optimal architectures, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n#### **2. Understanding Limitations**\n\n* **Challenges Addressed**: Identifying model weaknesses such as hallucination, factual inaccuracies, or poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data.\n* **Strategies**:\n  + Using datasets like [AdvGLUE](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/advglue?ref=blog.premai.io) for adversarial robustness testing.\n  + Employing benchmarks such as GLUE-Xfor OOD performance.\n* **Outcome**: Clear insights into scenarios where models may fail, enabling risk mitigation.\n\n#### **3. Ensuring Safety and Trustworthiness**\n\n* **Focus Areas**:\n  + Avoidance of harmful outputs, such as bias, toxicity, and misinformation.\n  + Protection against adversarial attacks and robustness to perturbations in input data.\n* **Benchmarks**:\n  + Safety-specific datasets (e.g., RealToxicityPrompts, [AdvGLUE](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/advglue?ref=blog.premai.io)).\n  + Comprehensive evaluations of alignment with ethical norms and human values.\n\n#### **4. Alignment with Human Values**\n\n* **Purpose**: Evaluating how closely the outputs of LLMs align with societal and ethical expectations.\n* **Challenges**:\n  + Detecting bias and stereotypes using datasets like [StereoSet](https://github.com/moinnadeem/StereoSet?ref=blog.premai.io) and [CrowS-Pairs](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/crows-pairs?ref=blog.premai.io).\n  + Measuring ethical alignment with frameworks such as ETHICS.\n* **Goal**: To develop systems that are inclusive, unbiased, and adaptable to diverse cultural contexts.\n\n#### **5. Risk Mitigation in Deployment**\n\n* **Why Important**:\n  + Mitigating risks such as data leakage, system manipulation, or operational failures.\n* **Evaluation Tools**:\n  + Red-teaming methods to probe for vulnerabilities.\n  + Robustness metrics to measure stability under adversarial conditions.\n* **Real-World Example**: Testing ChatGPT's ability to handle medical and legal queries without propagating misinformation.\n\nBy fulfilling these objectives, LLM evaluations ensure not only technical excellence but also societal trust and safety, laying the groundwork for responsible AI deployment across industries.\n\n## **Dimensions of LLM Evaluation**\n\nUnderstanding the dimensions of LLM evaluation is critical to designing robust benchmarks and protocols that align with their evolving capabilities and use cases. The key dimensions encompass the **what**, **where**, and **how** of evaluation, which provide a structured framework for assessing LLM performance across diverse domains and tasks.\n\n### **1. What to Evaluate**\n\n* **General Capabilities**: These include tasks such as natural language understanding, reasoning, and natural language generation. Evaluations often measure fluency, coherence, and contextual relevance of responses. [MSTEMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01448?ref=blog.premai.io), for example, introduces out-of-distribution (OOD) semantic templates to rigorously test these aspects.\n* **Domain-Specific Capabilities**: Performance tailored to specialized domains, such as legal, medical, or financial sectors, is critical. Benchmarks like PubMedQA and LSAT are specifically designed for these settings.\n* **Safety and Ethical Considerations**: Assessments of bias, toxicity, and alignment with human values are essential for ensuring trustworthy deployment.

Substantial progress has been made in both measuring and enhancing these abilities. Among the multitude of ways to advance space engineering research, one promising direction is the application of LLMs and foundational models in aiding in solving Ph.D. level research problems. To understand the full potential of LLMs in astrodynamics, we have developed the first Astrodynamics Problems Benchmark (APBench) to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this field. We crafted for the first time a collection of questions and answers that range a wide variety of subfields in astrodynamics, astronautics, and space engineering. On top of this first dataset built for space engineering, we evaluate the performance of foundational models, both open source models and closed ones, to validate their current capabilities in space engineering, and paving the road for further advancements towards a definition of intelligence for space.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [An astronomical question answering dataset for evaluating large language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04613-9?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 18 March 2025\n\n### [Textual interpretation of transient image classifications from large language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-025-02670-z?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 08 October 2025\n\n### [Evolutionary optimization of model merging recipes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00975-8?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle Open access 27 January 2025\n\n## Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform complex tasks, such as recognizing intricate patterns, driving cars, operating humanoid robots, and even piloting spacecraft[1](#ref-CR1 "Mirchandani, S. et al.

Powered by vast amounts of data - often terabytes collected from the internet - LLMs possess extensive general knowledge about the world. One notable advancement of LLMs over traditional artificial intelligence\xa0(AI) methods is their ability to perform zero-shot and few-shot learning, where they can complete tasks with little to no examples provided. With well designed prompting and fine-tuning, there have been a promising evaluation of the ability of the models to synthesize code from complex text[7](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR7 "Austin, J. et al.

Unlike traditional supervised or reinforcement learning, which often fails to handle rare events due to lack of exposure, LLMs are capable of handling such scenarios effectively. The interest in crafting foundational model application in space engineering has also been joined by Foutter et al.[10](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR10 "Foutter, M. et al.

With fine-tuning techniques, a (state-of-the-art) SoTA vision-language foundational model has been adapted to plan a rover’s navigation on Mars’ surface.\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that LLMs can also exhibit a basic understanding of the physical world. LLMs like GPT-4 are celebrated not just for their sophisticated logic but also for their expansive knowledge base[11](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR11 "Allen-Zhu, Z. & Li, Y.

Using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting—a method that guides the model step-by-step through reasoning processes—LLMs can perform a range of arithmetic and algebraic reasoning tasks by breaking them down into smaller, logical steps. With effective prompt engineering, LLMs have shown remarkable versatility. However, LLMs are still far away from an absolute satisfactory skill for solving mathematical problems due to the complex reasoning procedures that would be required[12](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR12 "Yu, L. et al.

On the quest of the big problem asked “Does LLM have intelligence”, we are testing its thinking capabilities. Astrodynamics problems can involve high complexity, making this field a perfect area, but void domain, to be explored in terms of determining LLM’s basic logical reasoning and problem solving skills. Astrodynamics problems cover domain-specific knowledge, causal explanation, advanced theories and operations, and spatio-temporal intelligence. LLMs have been implemented in physics and mathematics, with success coming from the logical reasoning and basic arithmetic operations. Arguments have been raised on the essence of LLMs, but recent work from Zhu et al.[14](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR14 "Allen-Zhu, Z. & Li, Y.

FinBen: A holistic financial benchmark for large language models (2024). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2402.12659\n                  \n                .").\n\nIn order to test the capabilities in an astrodynamics setting, we develop a specialized dataset and a detailed evaluation process for quantifying LLMs performance within this domain to establish a baseline and support future development, with the goal of bringing the astrodynamics community and AI community together in defining space foundational models. Figure\xa0[1](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig1) shows a basic framework of our astrodynamics dataset evaluation process.\n\nOur APBench (Astrodynamics Problems Benchmark) dataset covers a wide variety of problems in astrodynamics, including 2-body and 3-body problems, concepts on general space terminologies, state variables conversions, orbit determination, maneuver optimization, rendezvous and docking, interplanetary mission planning, computation and analysis of perturbations, etc. We challenge a wide variety of LLMs\xa0(see Table\xa0[3](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Tab3)), pinpointing individual strengths and weaknesses. To better suit to astrodynamics problems, we adapt an existing structure for the database that is efficient and informative for use with the general structure of Content and Questions as shown in Fig.\xa0[2](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig2). We source the benchmark questions to proven example problems rather than creating new questions[20](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR20 "Rein, D. et al. GPQA: A graduate-level Google-proof Q &A benchmark (2023). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2311.12022\n                  \n                .") as those were already thought through with solutions and we can push to the number of questions so that the evaluation covers a wide range of questions. With our automatic evaluating pipeline handling open questions in both numeric and message styles, we primarily focus on the final answers given by LLMs as this is the most straightforward way of evaluating the performance on the open questions curated in the dataset. Our result is the first trial in space engineering to generate a universal baseline for both the definition and pursuit of a space foundational model.\n\nThe goal of generating the APBench is to identify LLMs that best employ logic and knowledge to solve astrodynamics problems in a clear and concise step-by-step process. Our work explores the performance of existing LLMs in the field of space engineering, with the goal of examining one aspect necessary for building practical space foundational model. The aspect is to provide consistently correct performance to fundamental space engineering questions. We predict a possible timeline of 2025 for this aspect to be satisfied by LLM’s empirical performance improvement. Beyond the scope of astrodynamics, our data curation process and evaluation workflow aim at promoting the ongoing trend of customized benchmarking, providing a useful framework for evaluating artificial general intelligence (AGI) performance for other fields.\n\n## Results\n\n### The APBench dataset\n\nTo initiate this study, we focus on representative tasks of astrodynamics, leading to the creation of the first Astrodynamics Problems Benchmark (APBench). Similar to other STEM fields, textbook examples are a core component of engineering training used to qualify specialists in space engineering. Accordingly, we collected examples from available open resources to construct this dataset of college-level problem sets in astrodynamics. The data curation flow is shown in Fig.\xa0[3](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig3). Specifically, the selected problem sets should fulfill the following **data selection criteria**:\n\n* *Domain-specific.* The chosen problem sets require domain-specific knowledge, clear statement of the problem, and intermediate numerical computation ability.\n* *Solution process availability.* To support the analysis of LLMs’ ability to solve the problem sets, detailed solution processes would be required in the data to serve as a guideline for comparison purpose and guidelines.\n* *Various levels of difficulty.* The problem sets cover various fundamental astrodynamics topics at different difficulty levels. This would further support analyzing the LLMs’ current ability and potential improvements.\n\nAs shown in Fig.\xa0[2](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig2), the benchmark is provided in the following structure: a single problem set structure is composed of Content and *one or multiple* sets in Questions. Every set in Questions follows the same Question, Solution, Answer, Format, and Source structure.\n\nAPBench’s open question formulation and space engineering focus make it a challenging benchmark. In space engineering practice, problems are not confined to a predefined subset; thus, it is crucial to avoid predetermined setups or multiple-choice formats. Constructing multiple-choice options inherently involves solving the problem beforehand. Either including the multiple choices in a prompt, which leaks the information necessary for large language model to find, or excluding them, which equivalents to direct evaluation on the answer, provides little improvement to the setup. The complexity is not only revealed in the example case shown in Fig.\xa0[2](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig2) but also in the totally different procedures and steps taken by different language models in their attempts to answer the proposed question as illustrated by Figs.\xa0[4](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig4) and [5](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig5).\n\n#### Answer format classification\n\nLabeling questions is crucial for conducting a reasonable evaluation. We categorize the questions into two types: numeric and message. A numeric label indicates that the expected answer should focus on providing a realistic number, whereas a message label allows for a more relaxed structure of the answer. The Format is primarily determined by the nature of the answer. During the curation of the problem set, this labeling is also used in refining the Question section by specifying details such as units and whether the answer should be exclusively numeric. This additional information is incorporated into the curated question to enhance clarity and precision.\n\n#### Open bench and private bench\n\nWe summarize the source information in Table\xa0[1](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Tab1) for the open APBench and Table\xa0[2](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Tab2) for the private APBench. We list the sources with acronyms for easy tracking in the tables; for open APBench, we also provide the corresponding websites. The open APBench sources its content from online available information. Open APBench is the primary benchmark for people of interest to directly test their models’ abilities in solving space engineering problems. We provide this public benchmark also for validation and reproduction purposes. In the meantime, we also generate a private APBench. We choose to make this dataset private due to the copyright concern, which makes it unsuitable for public release. Instead, we provide only the number of problems we created from the database. The curation process described in Fig.\xa0[3](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig3) is well-suited for the reader interested in working with the listed sources or further expand to other sources.\n\n#### Ethical statement\n\nWe conducted a manual examination of our dataset to ensure that it does not contain any sensitive background information or raise ethical concerns. The benchmark dataset is intended solely for academic use. Its collection complies with the Fair Use Law in the United States of America.\n\n#### Minimization of data leakage risks\n\nCanary string is employed in the field to reduce the risk of leakage into foundation model training corpora[20](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR20 "Rein, D. et al. GPQA: A graduate-level Google-proof Q &A benchmark (2023). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2311.12022\n                  \n                ."),[33](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR33 "Srivastava, A. & et al. Beyond the imitation game: Quantifying and extrapolating the capabilities of language models (2023). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2206.04615\n                  \n                ."). It intends to help researchers filter our APBench dataset out of web-scraped training corpora, so that models do not train on the benchmark set.\n\n### Model performance analysis\n\nThe LLMs’ performances on APBench are shown in Table\xa0[3](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Tab3). Their evaluation of the APBench-\\(\\gamma\\), the largest open APBench, is shown in Fig.\xa0[6](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig6). The correctness on individual questions can be found in Supplementary Table\xa0[S1](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#MOESM1). The majority of model performance is below the 60% threshold, which represents a passing C-grade for space engineering. OpenAI’s o1-preview leads the performance, though its advantage is not significant. The model with superior math performance also performs well under the benchmark. Interestingly, the first fine-tuned model on arXiv’s astronomy abstracts, AstroLlaMA, performs poorly despite claims of possessing knowledge and developing “scholarly” work in space and astronomy domains. Llama models, even the largest and most promising one, ReflectionLlama, fall behind the top performers in the benchmark.\n\nSonnet was expected to perform similarly to or even surpass GPT-4o, and it delivers performance in line with those expectations. OpenAI models follow a clear trend of improvement, progressing from GPT-4 to o1-preview, with o1-preview leading the APBench, albeit by a narrow margin. If we consider these models as four iterations of OpenAI’s advancements, we might expect that two more iterations would be needed for OpenAI models to achieve a B-grade (80% accuracy), three to four iterations to reach an A-grade (90% accuracy), and five iterations to achieve the level of AI intelligence necessary for solving fundamental space engineering problems. It is important to note that we have employed relatively loose criteria for accuracy determination, and as AI models improve, a more stringent criterion will likely be required.\n\nLlama’s performances are also as expected. While Llama models generally lag behind in the APBench, a clear and intuitive growth trend is evident. Model size remains a significant factor in performance. The Llama 3.1 70B 4-bit quantized version delivers the best results, followed by Llama 3.1 8B. Interestingly, the newer, smaller models show notable improvement compared to older versions, as seen with the Llama 3.2 3B, which performs similarly to the 8B version. At the lower end of the performance spectrum, Llama 2 7B and Llama 3.2 1B show comparable results. The Llama 7B model, the earliest version, offers performance almost on par with the newer 1B model. This suggests that as the Llama models evolve, they increasingly concentrate their knowledge and capabilities.\n\nThe two Llama relatives—ReflectionLlama and AstroLlaMA – provide very interesting results. AstroLlaMA is fine-tuned on an extensive corpus of astronomy research abstracts, and it was expected to incorporate specialized knowledge from this scientific domain. However, its performance suffers when answering questions in APBench related to space engineering. In contrast, ReflectionLlama 3.1 performs reasonably well on APBench, maintaining a level of performance that was close to the top-performing Llama models. Notice that there is a difference in the target of conducting fine-tuning for AstroLlaMA and ReflectionLlama. AstroLlaMA’s specialized knowledge traces back to textual content in the abstracts of research papers, while in APBench there is an emphasis on conducting calculations to solve engineering problems. Thus, AstroLlaMA’s struggle with APBench hints at losing general reasoning and calculation skills while focusing on specialized knowledge. In the meantime, ReflectionLlama is fine-tuned to obtain a technique to conduct self-reflection in generating answers. This technique, similar to the effect of Chain-of-Thought[34](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR34 "Lu, P. et al. Learn to explain: Multimodal reasoning via thought chains for science question answering (2022). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2209.09513\n                  \n                ."), helps or at least does not hurt in solving engineering problems requiring calculations. Consequently, this leads to an interesting open question as to whether and how specialized knowledge could and should be incorporated with some abilities and techniques in providing solutions to advance the performance on solving problems requiring both – leading to a tailored foundational model that emphasizes both calculation-based and knowledge-based improvement.\n\nThe performance differences within the various versions of ReflectionLlama also follow an intuitive pattern. The full-floating-point version of ReflectionLlama 3.1 70B slightly outperforms its 4-bit quantized counterpart, which suggests that quantization does not drastically affect its ability to solve space engineering problems. This result reinforces the confidence that the performance of other quantized models is still representative of the full model. Besides, the framework also plays a role in performance differences. Ollama Reflection, a 4-bit quantized version of ReflectionLlama, performs less favorably than the 4-bit quantized version of ReflectionLlama from Hugging Face’s transformer framework. This indicates that the framework used for fine-tuning and inference may influence the overall performance of Llama relatives.\n\nThe best performing open-source model in the APBench benchmark is Qwen2.5-Math 72B. Note that this model went through the 4-bit quantization. As expected, performance within the Qwen2.5-Math family improves with increasing model size. Besides, the smallest model, Qwen2.5-Math 1.5B, outperforms larger models like Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, and Llama 3.2 1B and 3B. The medium-sized Qwen2.5-Math 7B model matches the performance of the best model from the Llama family, ReflectionLlama, despite Qwen2.5-Math 7B being only a 7B model compared to the larger 70B ReflectionLlama. The best-performing Qwen2.5-Math 72B model reaches a performance level similar to that of advanced closed-source models like Sonnet, GPT-4, and GPT-4o. This places Qwen2.5-Math 72B in a comparable tier to these high-performing closed-source models, demonstrating its potential in the space engineering domain.\n\n### Model performance evolution\n\nThe temporal evolution of the APBench results in Fig.\xa0[7](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig7) offers valuable insights into the development of the large language models. We observe a notable difference in the growth patterns of closed-source and open-source models. Closed-source models show a more linear progression in performance, reflecting steady improvements with each new iteration. In contrast, open-source models exhibit an exponential growth trend, indicating a faster pace of development and improvement. This disparity highlights the rapid advancements occurring within the open-source community, potentially driven by more open collaboration, frequent updates, and larger contributions from a diverse range of researchers and developers.\n\nThe open APBench is divided into three distinct versions: \\(\\text {APBench-}\\alpha\\), \\(\\text {APBench-}\\beta\\), and \\(\\text {APBench-}\\gamma\\), each defined by the different problem sets they include. \\(\\text {APBench-}\\alpha\\) consists of the smallest benchmark, including problem sets from Gordon and Qualify. \\(\\text {APBench-}\\beta\\) builds upon \\(\\text {APBench-}\\alpha\\) by adding problem sets from Braeunig, thus expanding the benchmark to a medium size. Finally, \\(\\text {APBench-}\\gamma\\) incorporates Lynnane into the problem sets, making it the full version of the APBench.\n\nThe performance on these three separate benchmarks is presented in Fig.\xa0[7](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig7), with markers \\(\\square\\), \\(\\triangle\\), and \\(\\bigcirc\\) and their release dates or specific model dates. The closed-source models are marked in blue, and the open-source models in red. The models’ abilities in space engineering are more effectively illustrated through the performance distribution, represented by their varying zero-shot accuracy on the different datasets. We also specify the accuracy in percentage for each model’s performance on APBench-\\(\\gamma\\), rounded to the first decimal point. The performance across the three benchmarks for a specific model is close to each other. This consistency results from both the stable construction of the benchmark and the models’ ability to solve engineering problems. They are not particularly sensitive to any of the source data. Similar to Fig.\xa0[6](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig6), we highlight the C-grade level 60% line. The closed-source model Sonnet passes the C-grade line on APBench-\\(\\alpha\\), while o1-preview performs above this line on all benchmarks. O1-mini’s performance hovers around the C-grade line. These results further validate the generally superior performance of closed-source models, as the only open-source model to achieve a similar performance is the Qwen2.5-Math 72B model on APBench-\\(\\alpha\\).\n\nBy separating the models into two distinct groups, we can extrapolate the evolution trends of each group, approximated by the selected Pareto Front evolution. We use APBench-\\(\\gamma\\), the full dataset, to approximate the performance evolution. For closed-source models, we select GPT-4, Sonnet, and o1-preview for the Pareto Front approximation, and a linear approximation effectively captures the growing trend. For open-source models, we choose Llama 2 7B, Reflection Llama 3.1 70B, and Qwen2.5-Math 72B as the Pareto Front, finding that an exponential approximation curve best fits the performance trend. From this separation, we observe a well-defined gap between closed-source and open-source models on APBench. However, we also notice that this gap is narrowing over time. The gap, which was approximately 30% in April 2024, has reduced to around 10% by October 2024. Open-source models, in general, are undergoing significant improvement and are on track to catch up with closed-source models in terms of APBench performance.\n\n### Model performance prediction\n\nWe anticipate a breakthrough in model performance in the upcoming years, based on the development trends revealed by the evolution analysis. Extrapolating from the performance trends, we expect that closed-source models will achieve 80% (B-grade) performance by January 10, 2025, and 90% (A-grade) performance by April 10, 2025, under the current scoring schema setup as shown in Fig.\xa0[1](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig1). For open-source models, although we have selected a number of models for prediction, we observe that the performance improvement within a model family, such as the Llama family, does not always follow an clear trend. The introduction of Qwen2.5-Math has significantly strengthened the overall open-source model field. The Pareto Front approximation suggests that open-source models could reach 80% accuracy by November 2, 2024, and 90% accuracy around the same time in 2024. However, this was not observed when this paper was written on December 1, 2024. However, as the open source model evolution follows less the heritages from the same model family and companies heritage. We should expect large variation from the prediction. In fact, if we exclude Qwen2.5-Math from the open-source models and focus solely on Llama-related models, we expect B-grade performance by August 9, 2026, and A-grade performance by December 11, 2026. This variance makes it difficult to precisely predict the future performance of open-source models, but we expect significant growth and a potential breakthrough in 2025.\n\nLastly, it is important to note that we have set a consistent buffer area for the evaluation criteria in scoring schema. This buffer will need to be tightened in the future as the precision requirements for high-stakes space engineering applications increase.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe development of APBench (Astrodynamics Problems Bench) represents a groundbreaking advancement in benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) for space engineering applications. Unlike existing benchmarks, which predominantly focus on general knowledge or high-school-level problems, APBench introduces domain-specific challenges that revolve around pivotal topics such as orbital mechanics, spacecraft dynamics, and mission design. By addressing these foundational aspects of space engineering, APBench bridges a crucial gap, enabling a more targeted evaluation of LLMs’ capabilities in this highly specialized field.\n\nAnother key contribution of this work is the comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models, encompassing both leading closed-source models and the rapidly maturing open-source alternatives. Our discussion explores the systematic construction of the evaluation framework, detailing the careful selection of problem sets and the design of adaptable scoring criteria. The evaluation reveals the strengths and limitations of these models in solving complex space engineering problems but also a compelling trend: while closed-source models currently dominate in terms of performance, open-source models are making rapid advancements and steadily narrowing the gap.\n\nMoreover, we project the timeline for achieving critical performance milestones. By analyzing trends in model evolution, we forecast when both closed-source and open-source LLMs might reach accuracy levels suitable for practical deployment in space engineering tasks. These projections underscore the accelerating pace of improvement, offering a glimpse into a future where LLMs could play a transformative role in addressing real-world engineering challenges.\n\nWe make the open APBench readily accessible so that we could introduce the space engineering problems to the broader community, encouraging not only space engineers but also the general AI research community to explore those problems. On the other hand, going beyond the fundamental space engineering questions presented in APBench, there are more advanced topics worth incorporating into the benchmark in the future, such as frozen orbit, mean motion resonance, periodic and quasi-periodic orbits, rotational dynamics, to name a few. With a continuing effort to enlarge and improve the benchmark itself, we expect the growth of APBench being similar to MATH[16](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR16 "Hendrycks, D. et al. Measuring mathematical problem solving with the MATH dataset (2021). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2103.03874\n                  \n                .") where continuous growth and further exploration would help pushing the boundary of foundational models in space engineering. The integration between LLM and astronomy, a closely related field, has shown a promising direction in terms of benchmark building and methodology innovation[18](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR18 "Ting, Y.-S. et al.

In addition, the incorporation of other tool using ability to deal with the high precision operation and other advanced techniques such as RAG could also enable a better performance in the future. Aiming for further assisting the growth of AGI explainability, we believe this foundational benchmark would support pinpointing the explainability for AI in space engineering, pushing AI’s general acceptance in “the final frontier”.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Related work\n\nWhile LLMs have transformed the field of NLP\xa0(Natural Language Processing) and have shown vast potential across various fields, rapid advancements in LLM capabilities present the possibility that in the future, superhuman AI systems could help advance “the final frontier”—space engineering. To measure our ability to align LLMs for this purpose, we need evaluation datasets that characterize the trustworthiness of these models on typical classroom-level astrodynamics problems. These tests should serve as the preliminary threshold before any trust is to be put in the answers from an LLM for practical applications to space system. As LLMs are used to answer increasingly difficult questions and are challenged on harder and harder questions where the scalable oversight, a phenomenon describing the incompetency in human’s generating solutions on their own to verify and test the improving difficulties LLM can solve, starts to appear[20](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR20 "Rein, D. et al.

In finance, the introduction of the FinBench benchmark[19](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR19 "Xie, Q. et al. FinBen: A holistic financial benchmark for large language models (2024). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2402.12659\n                  \n                .") addresses the need to evaluate LLMs in more complex and specialized tasks. Their dataset serves as the first benchmark designed specifically for inherently complex financial problems, facilitating the integration of finance with the rapidly advancing landscape of LLM development. Similarly, in the field of requirements engineering, Norheim et al.[58](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR58 "Norheim, J. et al. Challenges in applying large language models to requirements engineering tasks. Des. Sci. 10, e16. \n                  https://doi.org/10.1017/dsj.2024.8\n                  \n                 (2024).") highlights the limitations posed by the absence of benchmarks in advancing the understanding of LLMs in requirement engineering. The authors propose the development of benchmark datasets to enable systematic exploration and evaluation of LLM and NLP methods across various RE tasks in the future. In addition, as they cite, “the lack of benchmarks also makes it hard to benchmark the novel LLMs against past methods that have been applied (e.g., rule-based, feature-based ML)[59](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR59 "Lim, S.\xa0C. A Case for Pre-Trained Language Models in Systems Engineering. Master’s thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA (2022).")”. This underscores the critical role of benchmarks in evaluating the transformative capabilities LLMs pose across STEM disciplines, as there is a significant difference between LLMs and traditional machine learning.\n\nThe curated benchmark, APBench, is strongly inspired by the need to improve benchmark difficulties in recent years. This includes scaling up benchmarks, as seen in math-related ones, and increasing the difficulty levels, as observed in physics-related benchmarks. Additionally, APBench addresses the demand for field-specific benchmarks, with the field of space engineering raising unique concerns about LLMs’ specialized capabilities.\n\n### Data curation process and principles\n\nWe collected each problem from source PDF documents and processed them locally using a combination of scripts and manual operations to divide the source contents into two sections: Content and Questions. Within Questions, each individual set has five items: Question, Solution, Answer, Format, and Source, while sharing the same Content. To streamline this process, we wrote scripts employing OpenAI’s API to conduct batch process. The script identifies chunks of information, separates them into the the above mentioned sections, and extracts the problems and solution processes while organizing the content and multiple problems accordingly. The final answers are classified as either *numeric* or *message*, and the source is indicated by an *acronym* as shown in Tables\xa0[1](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Tab1) and\xa0[2](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Tab2). Numeric answers are converted to floating-point numbers while message answers retain their original expressions during model performance evaluation. Additionally, step-by-step solutions are included for each problem. The section Content is reused across multiple problems without duplication.\n\n#### Progressive problems settings\n\nThe source file may have multiple steps for a single problem set with a shared background information. We formulate the problem set structure as a shared content with multiple problems. The problems are organized as progressive problems. During evaluation process as illustrated in Fig.\xa0[1](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig1), we evaluate the correctness of the solution to a single problem and decide if the answered problem should be returned as part of the prompt based on the following condition: in the case of correctly solving a problem, the correctly answered problem along with its solution is attached to the content information. This provides additional context to the model, as many problems in the dataset under the same content are progressive. Figure\xa0[2](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig2) illustrates a case in which the answer to the second question could be directly used to solve the third question as the middle question is a necessary step for the right question.\n\nWe have also tested the performance of the model without information from past problems; this means that the model would treat each question independently. Our experiments indicate a similar performance; whether correctly answered questions are included in the prompt or questions are answered independently. The two cases of GPT-4 and \\(\\hbox {GPT}-4^{\\*}\\) in Table\xa0[3](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Tab3) indicate that for GPT-4 model (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09), employing progressive prompt and employing independent prompt result in similar performance. At first glance, this seems counterintuitive, but according to Park et al.[60](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR60 "Park, C.\xa0F., Okawa, M., Lee, A., Lubana, E.\xa0S. & Tanaka, H. Emergence of hidden capabilities: Exploring learning dynamics in concept space (2024). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2406.19370\n                  \n                ."), generative models possess “hidden capabilities” related to prompting. LLMs could answer a question correctly with a right way of prompting the question. A similar point was made in Zhu et al.[11](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR11 "Allen-Zhu, Z. & Li, Y. Physics of language models: Part 3.3, knowledge capacity scaling laws (2024). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2404.05405\n                  \n                ."),[14](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR14 "Allen-Zhu, Z. & Li, Y.

Physics of language models: Part 3.2, knowledge manipulation (2024). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2309.14402\n                  \n                .") regarding the concept of knowledge storage and extraction, suggesting that a question which can be correctly answered and which forms an important step for the next question can always be answered correctly. This implies that the correct answering of a question is determined not by its formulation but by its content. In essence, LLMs know what they know, and explicitly including what it could know in prompting is not necessarily the best way to extend their capability.\n\nDespite the similar testing performance observed for both employing progressive prompt and not, we chose to structure the benchmark with progressive problems. This approach provides a more concise way of formulating the dataset and avoids unnecessary duplication of content information. Moreover, this structure reflects the inherent setup of the problems, offering additional information that could be further explored in future studies.\n\n### Data source and ethical statement\n\nTo construct the dataset, we select a combination of online resources. We focus on including questions with more challenging, open-ended answers rather than the multiple-choice format commonly used in previous works[17](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR17 "Chen, W. et al. TheoremQA: A theorem-driven question answering dataset (2023). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2305.12524\n                  \n                ."),[51](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR51 "Wang, X. et al. SciBench: Evaluating college-level scientific problem-solving abilities of large language models (2024). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2307.10635\n                  \n                ."),[52](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR52 "Lu, P. et al. Learn to explain: Multimodal reasoning via thought chains for science question answering (2022). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2209.09513\n                  \n                ."),[62](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR62 "Lu, P. et al. Inter-GPS: Interpretable geometry problem solving with formal language and symbolic reasoning (2021). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2105.04165\n                  \n                ."). The problem sets include questions requiring both numeric and message answers. This aligns with our goal of providing the benchmarking on the topics of astrodynamics in a general way, since astrodynamics problems requiring either answers are common in the field. Moreover, since a message answer could include analytical solutions and other intuitive insights, those solutions have a broader impact than numerical ones tailored to a specific scenario.\n\n### Models and experiment setup\n\nWe evaluate the benchmarking dataset on both open-source and closed-source LLMs on our local machine, employing a zero-shot prompting strategy. The evaluation workflow is depicted by an example case in Fig.\xa0[7](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig7). For each set of questions within a single problem set, the Content and the Question are combined in the prompt to request the LLM’s final solution and answer. The answer from the LLM is then evaluated by comparing it to the correct answer in the problem set. In the zero-shot prompt setting, no prior examples or specific training data are provided. The model is expected to generate accurate responses based solely on its pre-existing knowledge and its ability to generalize from the prompt. This setup tests the LLM’s capacity to solve problems without relying on previously seen examples, thereby evaluating its inherent astrodynamics knowledge and problem-solving capabilities in the context of the task at hand.\n\nRecent development in fine-tuning has made the process of creating specialized LLM much more possible through not only programming techniques, but also the process of the knowledge and methods. The most recent update from OpenAI’s new model, OpenAI o1-preview, is the newest area of improvement. It demonstrates remarkable advancements in critical areas such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and coding. These improvements highlight the ongoing refinement of LLM capabilities in solving intricate problems across STEM disciplines. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of open-source models has led to an explosion of foundational models, accompanied by diverse and innovative methodologies for creating and optimizing LLMs.\n\nWe selected a diverse set of leading LLMs to evaluate their performance on APBench. On the closed-source side, we chose several models from OpenAI, including GPT-4 (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09), GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06), o1-mini (o1-mini-2024-09-12), and o1-preview (o1-preview-2024-09-12). These models represent a growing trend of confidence in their ability to solve a variety of problems efficiently. Additionally, we included Claude 3.5 Sonnet from Anthropic, released on 2024-06-14. Sonnet is reported to achieve similar or superior performance compared to GPT-4o on several math and coding-related benchmarks[63](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR63 "Anthropic. Claude 3.5 Sonnet model card addendum (2024). Accessed: 2024-12-02."). On the open-source side, we selected multiple versions of Llama from Meta, one of the most popular open-source models. Specifically, we included Llama 2 7B (Llama-2-7b-chat-hf), Llama 3.1 8B (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), Llama 3.1 70B (Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct), Llama 3.2 1B (Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct), and Llama 3.2 3B (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct). Due to hardware limitations, the large Llama 3.1 70B model was loaded using a 4-bit quantization method. These models cover a wide range of sizes and evolutionary steps within the Llama family. We also included AstroLLaMA[64](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR64 "Nguyen, T.\xa0D. et al. AstroLLaMA: Towards specialized foundation models in Astronomy (2023). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2309.06126\n                  \n                .") available on 2023-09-12, a fine-tuned model trained on arXiv astronomy abstracts, aiming to be able to conduct “scholarly astronomy”. Given the foundational connections between astronomy and space engineering, we selected this model to explore whether its training on astronomy content would aid in solving space engineering problems. Another significant inclusion was the *Reflection Llama* series. For the Reflection Llama 3.1 70B model (Reflection-Llama-3.1-70B), we evaluated both the full floating-point version and a 4-bit quantized version to test the impact of quantization. Additionally, we tested the Ollama Reflection model, another 4-bit quantized version of Reflection Llama under the Ollama framework. According to its developers, “trained using Reflection-Tuning, a technique developed to enable LLMs to fix their own mistakes”, Reflection Llama claimed to achieve SOTA performance on multiple benchmark on twitter. Last but the not the least, we also include Qwen2.5-Math of various size 1.5B (Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct), 7B (Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct), and 72B (Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct). For Qwen2.5-Math 72B model, we loaded it using 4-bit quantization. Qwen2.5-Math is reported to outperform most contemporary models in the mathematics domain.\n\n#### Automatic scoring pipeline and evaluation criteria\n\nAPBench is designed with the target of providing adequate evaluation for deploying foundational models in real-world engineering scenarios. APBench requires a prior Format of being either a numeric or message answer; an automatic scoring pipeline is developed accordingly.\n\nThe answer from LLMs is evaluated using predefined rules based on the Format of the reference answer in a problem set. The scoring schema is shown in Fig.\xa0[1](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig1). For numeric Format, the answer is converted from text strings to floating numbers, and numeric values are extracted for evaluation. An error margin, which adapts to the true answer of the problem, is used to determine if the answer is approximately correct. Similar error margin criteria has been adopted in Wang et al.[51](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR51 "Wang, X. et al. SciBench: Evaluating college-level scientific problem-solving abilities of large language models (2024). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2307.10635\n                  \n                ."); and this criteria can be adjusted, either tightened or loosened, in future evaluations. We employ an error margin expression of \\((0.1 + 0.01 \\log (|\\text {Answer}|))\\) to evaluate if the difference between an LLM answer and the reference answer is acceptable. In the case of this calculated error margin exceeds the range between 0 and 1, a fixed error margin of 0.1 is used. The known challenges associated with arithmetic operations were the primary consideration in determining the error boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Format of the expected Answer is message, a combination of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and an embedding-level evaluation is employed. The criteria for problem in Message format is a weighted score of \\(0.5(\\text {LLM-Judge} + ~\\text {Embedding-Similarity})\\), and a score higher than 0.6 is considered accurate; else wrong. A similar weighted way of evaluating the performance is also employed in Wang et al.[65](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR65 "Weng, Y. et al. Large language models are better reasoners with self-verification (2023). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2212.09561\n                  \n                .") while the single employment of LLM-as-a-judge was employed in Foutter et al.[66](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR66 "Foutter, M. et al. Adapting a foundation model for space-based tasks (2024). arXiv preprint \n                  arXiv:2408.05924\n                  \n                ."). The LLM-as-a-judge employs GPT4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) to evaluate if the LLM Answer and the reference Answer are the same between a scale of 0 to 10 and then normalize that number to 1. LLM’s ability to incorporate different sequence, formulation, and expression of the same expression gives it a unique role as a judge. The evaluation is also augmented by employing embedding-level evaluation. We select the pretrained model all-MiniLM-L6-v2[67](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#ref-CR67 "Reimers, N. & Gurevych, I. Sentence-BERT: Sentence embeddings using siamese bert-networks. in Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (2019).") to map Answer and Model Answer to two 384 dimensional dense vectors. As the expressions may use different symbols and orders, employing embedding-level similarity check could also support the decision from LLM-as-a-judge process. Embedding similarity is checked with the cosine similarity, naturally scaled between 0 and 1, adding vagueness into the criteria.\n\n### Benchmark dataset curation process\n\nThe benchmark dataset curation process is depicted in Fig.\xa0[3](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig3). We take the source files in various types (PDF, PNG, JPEG, etc.) and feed them into the block that inspect the source files. Prompt 1 is used to get the number of examples in the file. It is more efficient to include human in the next step of editing the pattern found by LLM and use that pattern with Prompt 2 to create the first JSON file JSON Type-1. JSON Type-1 only has two attributes: Problem and Solution. Then we use Prompt 3 to separate Problem into Content and Question, creating JSON Type-2 JSON file. However, the Question identified could be a combination of multiple questions, so we separate the Question and Solution simultaneously into multiple Questions and corresponding Solutions, generating JSON Type-3 JSON file.\n\nFurthermore, we employ a two-step operation with an if logic condition, to split Question and Solution further into more detailed Question and Solution. The corresponding prompts are Prompt 5 step 1 and Prompt 5 step 2. A human interference is introduced to evaluate the completeness of Question and Solution splitting. If it needs further splitting, we repeat the process. But if the Question and Solution cannot be further separated, we move to the step of updating Format, condensing Answer, and updating Question part. The corresponding prompt is also a two-step prompt: Prompt 6 step 1 to update the Format attribute, and Prompt 6 step 2 to use the updated Format attribute to condense Answer and update Question when the Format is numeric while do nothing for message Format.\n\nThroughout the process, we are able to conduct large amount of automatic operation over the creation of the benchmark datasets. Human interference is still needed in multiple places such as determining whether to further split Question and Solution; determining the quality of the Format determination; also as early as pattern determination in Source files. Finally, we achieve the updated JSON Type-3 JSON file with the attributes shown in Fig.\xa0[2](/articles/s41598-025-91150-5#Fig2).\n\nThe list of prompts are:\n\n### Model performance examples\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe open APBench datasets are available at <https://huggingface.co/datasets/woodywu/APBench>.\n\n## References\n\n1.

The pace of advancement of large language models (LLMs) motivates the use of existing infrastructure to automate the evaluation of LLM performance on computing education tasks. Concept inventories are well suited for evaluation because of their careful design and prior validity evidence. OBJECTIVES. Our research explores the feasibility of using an automated benchmarking framework to evaluate computer science (CS) concept inventories. We explore three primary objectives: evaluation of LLM performance on the SCS1 and BDSI concept inventories; informal expert panel review of items which had variations between LLM and expected student performance; and description of challenges with using benchmarking infrastructure as a methodological innovation. METHOD. We used the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) framework to evaluate the SCS1 and BDSI against 10 LLMS with zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning: GPT (3.5, 4.0), Claude (1.3, 2.0, 2.1), Llama (7B, 13B, 70B), Mistral v0.1 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B. We used psychometric data from prior studies to measure knowledge levels for each LLM run. We then conducted an informal expert review to qualitatively explore how question design, CS content knowledge, and LLM design may explain diferences between LLM and expected student performances. FINDINGS. Our quantitative analysis found that most LLM response patterns refected a below average introductory computing student with the SCS1 and did not ft the psychometric 2PL model for the BDSI. Our qualitative analysis identifed that LLMs performed well on code infll questions, but poorly on nested conditionals, runtime analysis, and longer questions. We also identifed several methodological challenges related to item security, translation, the structure when using HELM. IMPLICATIONS. We consider the feasibility of using automated benchmarking as a methodology to support more reproducible, replicable, and rigorous investigations to understand the intersection of LLM capabilities, computing concepts, and assessment design. We also consider connections between psychometric approaches and LLM evaluations to inform the design of computing assessments that are more resilient to LLM advancements.

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 26 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3632620. 3671097 1 INTRODUCTION: THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING LANDSCAPES OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly and have caught signifcant public attention [13, 71]. These models have hundreds of billions of parameters and train on broad datasets to enable adaptability to a wide range of downstream tasks, such as text and image generation [13]. These models also have several educational applications, ranging from assisting with grading [85] to generating open-ended practice exercises [110]. Furthermore, since LLM training data includes extensive code, researchers have also explored the utility of LLMs specifcally in computing education [87]. Timely evaluations of new LLM capabilities on computing education tasks, such as performance on assessments [98] and ability to generate code explanations [66, 93]), could inform the practice of computing education instructors and researchers alike. However, the pace of advancement in LLM performance make them difcult to rigorously evaluate through typical scholarly means. In the 100 days since OpenAI released its latest generation LLM, GPT-4 Turbo1, 29 diferent organizations released 35 new LLMs [99]. By contrast, computing education research publications typically publish annually for conferences (e.g. ICER, SIGCSE, ITiCSE, Koli Calling) and quarterly for journals (e.g. TOCE, CSE). Evaluations of LLM performance risk outpacing evaluations of their capabilities and afordances within computing education contexts. In response to the velocity of advancement and the broad adaptability of LLMs, Artifcial Intelligence (AI) researchers have resorted to developing benchmarks to evaluate LLM performance. These benchmarks are standardized tasks that attempt to measure LLM capabilities across a broad spectrum, including consideration of social biases [23, 79], mathematical problem solving, [48], and medical exams [40]. Joint eforts to develop and evaluate benchmarks have resulted in collaborative benchmarks such as the Beyond the Imitation Game (BIG-bench), which includes 204 tasks developed by 450 authors from 132 institutions [9]. Task topics are diverse, drawing upon problems from linguistics, social bias, math, software development, and beyond. Automating certain evaluations of LLM capabilities could enable more capacity to conduct more open-ended and human-centered evaluations. Echoing Baker [5], the goal of LLMs in computing education is not to use the most efective LLMs, but to fnd efective ways to develop knowledgeable and successful (human) learners. Within computing education research, this includes broadening participation in computing, preparing educators, developing quality curricular materials and assessments, and scaling eforts [10]. We argue that we cannot, and should not, automate evaluations of the impact of LLMs on these eforts. What we can do is automate some closed-ended evaluations (e.g. LLM performance on an assessment) to encourage deeper, more open-ended analyses (e.g. impacts of LLM usage on broadening participation) and thus support more rigorous overall evaluations of LLM performance. Within the context of computing education, closed-ended evaluations could include LLM performance of concept-inventories, assessments designed to determine whether a student has accurate working knowledge of a specifc set of computing concepts (e.g. introductory computing knowledge [82] or data structures [86]). This paper explores the feasibility of using an automated benchmarking framework, Holistic Evaluation of Foundation Models (HELM) [61] to support more reproducible, replicable, and rigorous evaluations of LLM capabilities in computing education. Reproducibility refers to the ability to achieve the same fndings as a prior study using existing data that 1released 5 November 2023 [99] Manuscript submitted to ACM 3 Using Benchmarking Infrastructure to Evaluate LLM Performance on CS Concept Inventories prior study [103], and replication refers to following the design of a prior study with newly collected and analyzed data to determine if a new study yields the same fndings as a prior study [103]. Prior work in CER include literature reviews of empirical studies, replication studies, and infrastructure to improve reproducibility. In a systematic literature review of computing education research literature, Heckman et al. [38] found that over 80% of reviewed papers included some form of empirical evaluation, with quantitative evaluation methods being most frequently reported. Examples of prior replication studies in CER include investigating subgoal labeling [77] and designing a new language-agnostic knowledge assessment [82] in CS1. Replication studies that fail to replicate previous fndings are also useful (e.g. [58, 72]), as they can identify alternative explanations for prior fndings. To support more reproducibility and replication in CER, prior work has explored pre-registering studies Brown et al. [14]. More reproducible and replicable empirical studies can result in knowledge building through meta-analyses [74] and theory building [70, 80]. We focus on the performance of 10 LLMs on two introductory CS concept inventories: the SCS1, which measures introductory computing (CS1) knowledge [82], and the BDSI [86], which measures knowledge of data structures. We chose to evaluate concept inventories because they have strong validity evidence and likely were not used to previously train LLMs, overcoming two common issues with existing benchmarks [60, 91, 115]. We compared LLM performance with expected student performance by using psychometric properties reported from prior studies. This comparison enabled us to identify unusual items, which we defne as items for which LLM and expected student performance deviated (e.g., LLMs performing unusually well on difcult questions). We then conducted a qualitative review with computing education, LLM, and assessment design experts to understand how LLM design, item design, and computing concepts may afect LLM performance when compared to expected student performance. By doing so, we explored the following research questions: (1) How do LLMs perform on the SCS1 and BDSI concept inventories? (2) How do AI, computing education, and assessment experts interpret deviations in LLM capabilities from expected student performance? (3) What are challenges with using benchmarking infrastructure to automatically evaluate LLMs? In this paper, we contribute a feasibility study into the use of automated benchmarking infrastructure as a method\xad ological innovation for computing education. This feasibility study includes 1) a mixed-methods empirical evaluation to evaluate the performance of 10 LLMs on two CS concept inventories in comparison to expected student performance and 2) a description of methodological challenges in leveraging benchmarking infrastructure to automate LLM evaluations for computing education research. 2 RELATED WORK In this section, we describe related work pertaining to the opportunities and challenges with evaluating LLMs with benchmarks. We then discuss computing education research on concept inventories (CIs) and their validity evidence. Collectively, this prior work situates our study in using HELM [61] as automated benchmarking infrastructure to evaluate LLM performance on two concept inventories (SCS1 [82] and BDSI [86]). 2.1 Benchmarking Large Language Models (in Computing Education Research) A language model (LM) aims to model the generative likelihood of word sequences—to predict the probability that one word follows another in a stream of text [114]. LM research has advanced signifcantly over the years, with the Manuscript submitted to ACM 4 Ali et al. following progression: 1) statistical models (SLMs) [46], 2) neural language models (NLMs) [8], 3) pre-trained language models (PLMs) [59], and, most recently, 4) large language models (LLMs) [114]. These models, broadly speaking, are often considered to fall under the broad class of foundation models, an umbrella term for any model trained on broad data and capable of being fne tuned for specifc tasks [13]. From a technical standpoint, LLMs are simply very large PLMs; this upsizing is achieved by scaling the model or the data size and results in better performance on several tasks. One such improvement is the chief source of the current fascination with LLMs across domains: LLMs enable applications which possess a remarkable ability to carry on realistic dialogue with humans [114]. The most popular example of such an application is ChatGPT [109]. LLMs are often evaluated via comparison with existing benchmarks. However, there is still the question of how LLMs are actually evaluated (i.e., what measures/metrics are used to evaluate them). In their survey on evaluating LLMs, Chang et al. [16] note that evaluation can be split into two categories: automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Automatic evaluation is more efcient and standardized, generally focused on measuring LLM performance via the following four metrics: (1) Accuracy: How well a model performs a predefned task, as measured by autmated metrics such as F1 score or Exact Match. (2) Calibration: The level of agreement between the model’s confdence level and its actual accuracy. (3) Fairness: A measure of whether the model is consistent across various group attributes. (4) Robustness: How well a model performs against challenging inputs and adversarial attacks. In some con\xad texts, including within HELM, robustness can also include a model’s ability to perform well even with input transformations and/or perturbations. Human evaluation is more time consuming and subjective, but can lead to more reliable evaluations for tasks that are hard to standardize, such as those that involve open generation [84]. Chang et al. [16] outline the following six human assessment criteria for LLM evaluation: (1) Accuracy: In this case, accuracy refers to the precision and correctness of the output as judged by human experts, as opposed to calculation via automated metrics. (2) Relevance: The appropriateness and signifcance of the output. (3) Fluency: How smoothly the model’s output reads, including syntax, semantics, and tone/style. (4) Transparency: How well the model explains its reasoning. (5) Safety: The model’s ability to refrain from producing harmful or inappropriate content. (6) Human alignment: How well the model produces output that is in line with a human’s expectations and values. This criterion seeks to ensure, at a high level, positive interactions with human users. An alternative dimension on which LLM evaluation can be considered is open-ended vs. closed-ended evaluations. Open-ended evaluations consider an LLM’s profciency at tasks that do not have a single correct answer, such as writing open-ended story content or engaging in critical reasoning. Closed-ended evaluations involve tasks that can be graded without judgment. A helpful analogy here is to consider the diference between grading a multiple-choice exam (closed ended) and an argumentative essay (open ended); both serve their purposes, but are fundamentally diferent. Within CS Education LLM research, diferent types of evaluations have been used for diferent research goals. Researchers have engaged in open-ended analyses to evaluate automatically generated programming exercises [22], context-aware error explanations [92, 100], code explanations [94], and student code feedback [6]. For tasks that simply involve evaluating GPT’s performance on an assessment [97] (especially a multiple-choice one), researchers often use a Manuscript submitted to ACM 5 Using Benchmarking Infrastructure to Evaluate LLM Performance on CS Concept Inventories closed-ended evaluation followed by a deeper, open-ended analysis [30, 96]. We advocate for this dual approach in our work. Stopping at a closed-ended, automatic evaluation for assessment instruments does not provide insight into why an LLM performs the way that it does, and it misses the opportunity to learn about how educators might design assessment materials that are more resilient to accurate completion by LLMs. We argue in favor of moving from only a closed-ended, automatic evaluation of assessment instruments to one that also includes open-ended, human evaluation, and in our paper we demonstrate one method of doing so. 2.1.1 Critiques of Benchmarking. We frame critiques of current automated benchmarking practices from the perspec\xad tives of machine learning, psychometrics, and value tensions. A machine learning concern with benchmarks relates to benchmark leakage. This term generally refer to when a LLM trains on data that we want to evaluate it against, such as training on benchmarks. This violates a fundamental idea of machine learning, that a model should never train on the test set. Benchmark leakage refers to data or tasks used for evaluation or test sets that are used for model training [60, 91, 115]. Benchmark leakage includes test data contamination in various forms: the inclusion of test data guidelines (e.g. information about a concept inventory), examples (e.g. concept inventory questions without solutions), and/or labels/annotations (e.g. concept inventory questions annotated with solutions) in the pre-training data [60, 115]. Benchmark leakage may also include task contamination, the inclusion of task training examples in pre-training data, such as examples of concept inventory question structures [60]. This may invalidate zero or few-shot in-context learning approaches, but may also be acceptable when the structure of a task is not part of the evaluation (e.g. wanting an LLM to train on the structure of multiple choice questions to evaluate computing knowledge using multiple choice questions) [24]. Recommendations to address benchmark leakage include benchmarks that refect broader capabilities, data decontamination checking by LLM developers, disclosure of training datasets, and more diverse sets of test prompts for benchmark maintainers [60, 91, 115]. However, the inclusion of benchmarks in training data for LLMs is an ongoing concern with their continued use. A psychometrics-related concern with benchmarks involves validity. There are multiple perspectives of validity according to educational statistics and psychometric literature [51, 75, 76]. A common framing of validity defnes it as “an overall evaluative judgment of the degree to which empirical evidence and theoretical rationales support the adequacy and appropriateness of interpretations and actions on the basis of test scores or other modes of assessment” [75, 76]. Related to benchmarking, validity is an evaluative summary of evidence for how people can interpret and use benchmark results [51, 76]. Raji et al. [89] has argued that benchmarks lack construct validity [75, 76], evidence that LLM performance on benchmarks refects processes, strategies, and knowledge of a latent construct (e.g. computing knowledge). A particular concern relates to construct-irrelevant variance [76], where a benchmark is too broad and as a result, score variance is associated with confounding constructs or other properties irrelevant to the intended construct. The broad applicability of LLMs makes it difcult to consider the validity of interpreting and using benchmark results, in part because latent constructs of interest (e.g. “common tasks” [89], bias, programming knowledge) are underspecifed and often context dependent. For example, benchmarks to evaluate gender bias in LLMs (e.g. [35, 52, 83]) tend to focus on binary genders in relation to occupational stereotypes (e.g. how stereotypes often associate doctors as being men and nurses as being women). This consideration of only two genders within occupational contexts is largely because of data availability [16, 52]. However, gender is a fuid social construct that can be context dependent (e.g. a nonbinary person coming out to close friends, but not to workplace colleagues or school classmates) [31]. Therefore, construct-irrelevant variance may occur when considering gender bias in LLM outputs beyond occupational contexts (e.g. in educational or social contexts) and when considering more than two genders. Manuscript submitted to ACM 6 Ali et al. An ethical concern with benchmarks relates to the values embedded into designing benchmarks. Dehghani et al. [21] identifed four biases that impact LLM researchers benchmarks: task selection bias (dependence of model performance on tasks and datasets selected for benchmarks), community bias (efects of community pressures to develop and emphasize certain benchmarks), statefulness of benchmarking (decisions made in developing new models are informed by the errors and successes of previous models on the same benchmarks, and rigging (selecting evaluation methods and metrics that best ft given model and resource constraints). Blili-Hamelin and Hancox-Li [11] drew connections between ethical tensions of LLM benchmarking and IQ tests [28]. These ethical concerns related to task-selection, narrowly defned standards for construct validity, and positive feedback loops between benchmarks and types model development. 2.1.2 LLMs in Computing Education Research. LLMs have swiftly been incorporated into computing education research within the last year, with researchers exploring their potential for various tasks including enhancing error messages [56], generating code [81], generating code explanations [57, 65], and simulating students using LLMs [1]. Some researchers have even explored the potential of LLMs to directly generate advanced educational materials, such as with Agrawal et al. [2]’s CyberGen system. In their 2023 report on the expanding use of generative AI in computing education research, Prather et al. [87] identifed 71 articles related to the topic, with over three-fourths published in 2023 itself. Papers centered around 5 primary topics: 1) assessing the performance of LLMs, 2) position papers/surveys/interviews, 3) interactions between programmers and LLMs, 4) use of LLMs to review student work, and 5) use of LLMs to generate educational resources and materials. In their report, the authors additionally build upon existing research by benchmarking several generative AI models on a group of computing education data sets. Specifcally with respect to benchmarking in computing education within generative AI, researchers published a wealth of impactful fndings in 2023 and 2024, attempting to keep up with the advancements of language models and their efect on performance in various areas. Mahon et al. [68] investigated GPT-4’s performance on standardized national exams for high school computer science in Ireland and the UK, fnding that GPT-4 performed quite well overall, but struggled with questions involving images or symbols. Savelka et al. [96] found a strong rate of improvement when benchmarking GPT-4 (as compared with previous generations of the model) on three Python courses containing everything from simple multiple-choice questions to involved free-coding questions spanning multiple fles. Prather et al. [87] also report on benchmarking as part of their above paper, focusing on the task of generating a solution to a programming problem and reviewing a wide range of available data sets to categorize the content they contained [87]. Finally, they replicate one of the frst studies on LLMs in computing education [30] using GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and CoPilot on the original data, as well as on two previously untested data sets, the Automated Programming Progress Standard (APPS) [39] and FalconCode [20]. Like [96], they found signifcant improvements with newer models while also reporting on challenges with LLMs parsing question formats and adding additional output which was not specifed in the problem description. Prather et al. [87] also noted two challenges to benchmarking that are particularly relevant to our work: 1) It can be difcult to meaningfully benchmark LLMs because of the speed at which new, more capable models are released, and 2) because papers often use a wide variety of prompts and evaluation approaches without delving into the details, it can be difcult to validate results. Our methodology addresses the frst concern via our use of HELM: Because HELM is consistently updated with the latest LLMs, integrating CIs into the framework will allow new model benchmarks to be computed more efciently. To provide the opportunity for replication as well as encourage further work, we describe our evaluation methodology in great detail in Section 3. Manuscript submitted to ACM 7 Using Benchmarking Infrastructure to Evaluate LLM Performance on CS Concept Inventories 2.2 Concept Inventories A concept inventory (CI) is a standardized assessment used to measure student understanding of core concepts in a discipline, designed specifcally to elicit information about misconceptions [101]. CIs serve to identify areas of conceptual difculty prior to instruction and evaluate the impact of pedagogical interventions in students’ conceptual understanding [63]. Concept inventories are typically involve multiple choice items/questions with one correct solution. All other solutions are incorrect and collectively referred to as distractors. A well-designed CI item has distractors which each refect a common misconception about a concept; thus, based on the answers students select, instructors can identify student misconceptions about the material [63]. Concept inventories date back to 1992, with the advent of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI, [44]). At the time, physics students held several misconceptions about Newtonian force which physics courses were not correcting [36]. In the years following its release, the FCI led to revolutionary changes in physics education (e.g. peer instruction [18]) and thus precipitated the adoption of CIs across STEM felds [7, 26, 64, 78].CI work reached computer education nearly two decades later, starting with introductory work identifying misconceptions [33, 50]. This preliminary work led to the publication of the frst two empirically validated CIs in computer science: the Digital Logic Concept Inventory (DLCI) and the Foundational Computer Science 1 Assessment (FCS1) [42, 102]. With this foundation laid, CI work in computer science slowly began to expand. The frst literature review studying such work was conducted in 2014 by Taylor et al. [101], who documented several important points detailing the development of research work: • Though more researchers were beginning to explore the space, progress was still limited in 2014. Taylor et al. recorded 6 total CIs in computer science, and among these only the FCS1 and DLCI were fully developed and validated. • Misconceptions were common among introductory computer science students, and so CI research is important and worth expanding. • Taylor et al. noted several challenges in building CIs unique to computer science, revolving around the fact that computer science is a young and fuid feld (especially in comparison to a natural science such as Newtonian physics) with variations in how it is taught. For example, many courses teach the same concepts in diferent programming languages. Do these warrant distinct CIs? Are important, more “overarching” skills in computer science–such as debugging and program design–appropriate for inclusion in a CI? Their documentation of these challenges went on to explicitly and implicitly infuence future work in this space. In the years following Taylor et al.’s review, the speed of computer science CI research increased substantially. In 2023, Ali et al. published a systematic review with the following updated fndings [3]: • As of 2023, there were 33 total computer science CIs in existence, 12 of them validated. • Taylor et al.’s prediction of potential challenges proved prescient. Though researchers rarely set out with the intention of addressing these challenges, they nearly always presented themselves, and as such, progress toward potential solutions was made. For instance, one novel solution to varied programming languages was to develop a method for transitioning a CI from one language to another [15]. • Research also expanded beyond simply building new CIs using established methods, with some researchers actively exploring novel methodologies for CI development itself [90, 107]. CI work in computing education continues to expand today. By incorporating CIs as benchmarks/scenarios in HELM, we hope to make evaluation of future LLM capabilities more consistent with evaluations on other LLMs and timely. Manuscript submitted to ACM 8 Ali et al. 2.2.1 Validity Evidence and Psychometrics. Item Response Theory (IRT) methodologies are foundational to psycho\xad metrics [19]. IRT provides more sample-agnostic statistics which estimate learner knowledge and question properties separately using falsifable models. IRT enables the estimation of question-level and test-level parameters, as well as test-takers’ knowledge levels. This provides estimates of the difculty and discrimination of each question for learners of diferent knowledge levels. It does this by estimating the correspondence between unobserved latent variables (e.g. learners’ computing knowledge, difculty of questions) and observable evidence of knowledge (e.g., people’s responses to questions). By ftting response data to a model (e.g. logistic model), we can estimate question parameters (e.g. difculty) with fewer assumptions about the characteristics of the sample. We can also make predictive statements about learner performance based on knowledge level. By doing so, estimates of test-taker, item, and assessment properties generalize beyond the specifc sample of test-takers. A key principle of IRT is placing test-takers and questions on the same normally distributed, typically unidimensional continuum. The center of 0 represents the knowledge level for the average test-taker of the population. An average test-taker would have a 50% chance of getting an average question correct. Therefore, if a test-taker’s predicted knowledge level is greater than the difculty of the question, then they are more likely to get the question correct. This continuum helps model the relationship between a learner’s latent knowledge level and their observed item performance as a monotonically increasing function. In this paper, we focus in particular on the 2 Parameter Logistic (2PL) model because prior work ft responses to the SCS1 [112] and BDSI [86] to the 2PL model. For the 2PL model, each item has two parameters: difculty and discrimination. The estimated difculty of a question is the knowledge level at which a test-taker has an equal chance (50%) of answering a question correctly and incorrectly. Discrimination is how well a question distinguishes between test-takers of varying knowledge levels. A high discrimination value is desireable because it indicates that the probability of a test-taker answering correctly changes signifcantly based on their knowledge level. With discrimination, we can see if questions at the same difculty level provide more or less information about test-takers’ knowledge. 3 METHOD To answer our research questions, we automatically evaluated the concept inventories with HELM. We then conducted expert review [73] on items with LLM performance deviating from expected student performance. We describe our methodology for selecting CIs and evaluating CIs with HELM. We then describe our mixed-methods analysis involving modeling LLM performance with IRT and reviewing unusual items with AI, computing education, and psychometric experts. 3.1 Concept Inventory Selection & Item Translation Authors of CIs generally do not make them publicly available, as widespread access to the test items would interfere with the instrument’s validity. If a student saw the questions beforehand, they could simply memorize the answers, and the CI would lose its ability to ascertain the student’s misconceptions. In order to obtain the CIs of interest, we reached out to each CI’s author team independently. The full list of CIs we attempted to obtain was drawn from the validated list of CIs from Ali et al. [3], along with two additional CIs on Cybersecurity [41] and the Rust Programming Language [17] which were validated after the publication of Ali et al. [3]. We successfully obtained seven CIs, including two and omitting fve. The two CIs we included in this study were the Second Computer Science 1 Assessment (SCS1, [82]) and the Basic Data Structure Inventory (BDSI, [86]). The SCS1, properly known as the Second CS1 Assessment, is a CI developed in Manuscript submitted to ACM 9 Using Benchmarking Infrastructure to Evaluate LLM Performance on CS Concept Inventories 2016 which focuses introductory computer science concepts [82]. Formally, the SCS1 is a replicated CI, isomorphic to the earlier FCS1, or Foundational CS1 Assessment [102]. Parker et al. [82] developed the SCS1 to enable free use by a broad research community, arguing that replication of assessments is important to addressing inbuilt issues and adding extensions. The SCS1 is an assessment instrument which has validity evidence from multiple independent studies [112]. Conceptually, it is suited for computer science students who have completed an introductory programming course. Additionally, it makes use of a pseudocode language to enable accessibility to students with backgrounds in diferent programming languages. The BDSI, or Basic Data Structures Inventory, was released in 2019 and makes use of an extended version of the SCS1 pseudocode language to assess students’ profciency in data structures [86]. It tests concepts at a level above the SCS1, and it is suited for students who have completed a CS2 course in computer science, generally connoting a course that introduces students to data structures [43]. We excluded the fve other CIs for the reasons stated below: • Basic Recursion CI [37]: Unlike most CIs, the Basic Recursion CI consists of completely open-ended questions. This presented difculties in automatically checking for correctness within HELM. • BST and Hash Tables CI [53]: This CI consists of several images and graph structures; determining how to best represent these to LLMs that do not support images directly will require further work. Our work provides preliminary insight into this, as the BDSI also included graphs, but to a much lesser extent. • CCI (Cybersecurity CI) [41]: The CI authors did not consent to inclusion of instrument because of similar ongoing research. • First-Year Computer Science CI [104]: This CI is currently only available in German, which is not as comprehen\xad sible as English to the majority of LLMs; this would have confounded the results. • MG-CSCI (Middle-Grades Computer Science CI) [88]: This CI consists primarily of questions in the blocks-based programming language Snap!, represented as images. Thus, we faced a similar issue as with the BST and Hash Tables CI in representing the questions. 3.2 Integrating CIs into HELM To systematically evaluate LLM capabilities to answer the SCS1 and BDSI concept inventories, we used the automated benchmarking infrastructure provided by the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM). HELM is an open-source LLM benchmarking framework built by Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM). HELM provides benchmarking infrastructure for nearly 150 LLMs and includes over 100 benchmarks, and provides researchers with the ability to add new models and benchmarks as work progresses [61]. 2. To add a benchmark to HELM, one must implement a HELM Scenario subclass in Python, which defnes how data is imported, parsed, and converted into HELM Instance objects. A single Instance object represents a CI question and its associated answer choices. For our work, we implemented a new Scenario within HELM, CIMCQAScenario, which handles the conversion of a JSON fle representing a CI into a list of Instances that can be passed into HELM’s core program. This infrastructure enabled consistent prompt formatting for single-option multiple-choice questions across multiple benchmarks. Because the CIs we worked with were initially only available as PDF or Microsoft Word fles of questions and answers, we structured them into JSON fles as a preprocessing step. In doing so, we made a number of decisions concerning 2Number of LLMs, scenarios, metrics as of March 2024. https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/classic/latest/ Manuscript submitted to ACM 10 Ali et al. how to represent code indentations, graph structures, tables, and other aspects of the CIs that did not have immediately clear text representations. We made the following key decisions: • Line breaks in code are indicated with a newline character. • One level of indentation is represented via four space characters. • Questions/answers in table format are represented by listing each row individually, with the column title preceding each individual entry. • Any tree diagrams in the questions are represented with textual descriptions. • Questions with multiple correct answers (specifcally, two questions on the BDSI) are excluded, as HELM does not currently support this answer format. A more detailed document outlining the design decisions made for each CI is available as supplemental material to this paper. We attempted to prevent LLM creators from using CIs to train future models but largely failed to do so. The only LLM developer that provided the capabilities to restrict data usage at the time of this study was OpenAI. However, this required an Enterprise account, which we did not have. We did avoid publicly sharing the CI questions and answers as a published benchmark. This mitigated the risk of test data leakage (CI questions and solutions cannot be scraped from the web), but did go against typical practices of publishing benchmarks for others to interrogate and use [9]. We obtained verifcation from SCS1 and BDSI maintainers that we had permission to use their CIs prior to running any CI questions through an LLM. Finally, in order to enable few-shot runs of the model, we developed a set of in-context learning examples [24]: 5 for the SCS1 and 3 for the BDSI. These examples are not used to fne tune models for better performance; rather, they assist HELM in familiarizing itself with the correct input-output structure for evaluation items. This helps reduce situations where an LLM response is incorrectly evaluated due to a minor variation in the desired output format. We chose to evaluate the following 10 LLMs created by four organizations: (1) Anthropic Claude v1.3, Anthropic Claude 2.0, and Anthropic Claude 2.1 (by Anthropic) (2) GPT-3.5 Turbo (0613) and GPT-4 (0613) (by OpenAI) (3) Llama 2 (7B), Llama 2 (13B), and Llama 2 (70B) (by Meta) (4) Mistral v0.1 (7B) and Mixtral (8x7B 32K seqlen) (by Mistral AI) These models refect a subset of models from HELM Lite [62] that were available at the time. 3.3 Analysis 3.3.1 Qantitative Analysis: Psychometric Properties to Compare LLM and Student Performance. We used difculty and discrimination parameters defned in prior work ([86, 112]) to ft the SCS1 and BDSI to separate 2PL models. We then checked whether LLM response patterns were consistent with each 2PL model. We checked the person-ft statistic �� , a standardization of the test-taker log likelihood function � to address the interaction of ��(�) and � [19, 25, 45]. �� is standardized, so a value of 0 denotes a perfectly expected or typical response pattern. Values above 2.0 could indicate overftting (unexpectedly good ft) and below -2.0 could indicate noisy or unexpectedly poor ftting [45]. If the person-ft statistic was acceptable (|�� | < 2.0), then we reported the latent knowledge level � of each LLM run, efectively treating each one as independent test-takers and answering our frst research question. � is normalized, with 0 denoting an “average” test-taker, > 0 denoting an above average test-taker, and < 0 denoting a below average test-taker [19]. Manuscript submitted to ACM 11 Using Benchmarking Infrastructure to Evaluate LLM Performance on CS Concept Inventories 3.3.2 Qalitative Analysis: Informal Expert Panel Review. We identifed unusual items in which LLM performance on these items deviated from expected student performance. To calculate expected student performance, we used the difculty parameter (�) from the 2PL model for each item. � is efectively a z-score [19], with the proportion of the normal curve above that value representing the proportion of students with a ≥ 50% expected probability of getting the item correct. We then compared that percentage to the proportion of LLMs that got an item correct. We considered two kinds of unusual items: those with high difculty and those with low difculty. Unusual high difculty items are those with the greatest difculty that had a greater proportion of LLM runs getting them correct when compared to the expected proportion of students. Therefore, unusual high difculty items are those in which LLMs performed unexpectedly well. Unusual low difculty items are those with the lowest difculty in which the proportion of LLM runs getting them correct is less than the expected proportion of students getting it correct. Therefore, unusual low difculty items are those in which LLMs performed unexpectedly poorly. We considered at most three high difculty and low difculty items that fulflled this criteria. Three authors participated in reviewing unusual items. These authors had experience in computing education research (three authors had collectively published over 12 papers to computing education research venues), teaching higher education computing courses (two authors had served as instructors; all four had experience as teaching assistants), psychometrics (one author had previously published multiple papers related to educational statistics and assessment design, and one author had developed materials for machine learning courses taught internationally), and LLMs (one author had published multiple papers on benchmarking and had industry experience developing deep learning algorithms). The goal of this informal expert panel review [54] was to understand how LLM design, assessment design, and/or computing knowledge may explain deviations in LLM and expected test-taker performances. For each unusual question, experts considered whether the original question design, computing concept it assessed, or an aspect of the LLM design may have resulted in performance that difered from the expected question difculty. We also considered whether the prompt structure could have been a confound. A previous psychometric evaluation of the SCS1 [112] included item trace plots as supplementary material [111]. These plots show the expected probability of selecting each multiple choice option for learners of varying knowledge levels. We used these plots to determine whether trends in incorrect LLM responses aligned with common student misconceptions. 4 RESULTS 4.1 RQ1: LLM Performance Table 1 shows the results of person-ft statistics, with it and Figure 1 showing the knowledge level estimates for each LLM run with an acceptable ft. For the SCS1, we found that the 2PL model poorly ft the response patterns for Anthropic Claude v1.3 (zero and few shot), Llama 2 (7B) (zero and few shot), and Llama 2 (70B) (zero shot). The remaining models also had response patterns that refected below average CS1 students, ranging from Llama 2 (7B) with few shot prompting (� = −2.52 ± 0.58) to GPT-4 (0613) with zero shot prompting (� = −0.33 ± 0.22). Only fve of the 20 LLM runs had responses that ft the 2PL model for the BDSI, with all other models being too noisy and poor of fts (�� < −2.0). The LLMs with acceptable person-ft for the BDSI were all three Anthropic Claude models with few shot prompting and GPT-4 (0613) with zero and few shot prompting. These fve instances produced responses that refected CS2 students with data structures knowledge ranging from approximately average (GPT-4 (0613) with zero shot, � = 0.12 ± 0.44 to above average (Anthropic Claude 2.0 with few shot, � = 0.85 ± 0.51).

In all four runs, response patterns for the SCS1 refected below average CS1 knowledge (� < 0) but approximately average to above average knowledge of data structures (� ≥ 0), typically considered a more advanced CS2 concept. 4.1.1 Validity Check: Number of Invalid Responses. LLM runs could still output invalid responses (e.g. a new line or word), which HELM would score as incorrect. We therefore attempted to correct for this using few shot in-context learning, as described in section 3.2. Table 2 shows the frequency of invalid responses outputted from zero shot and few shot learning runs for each concept inventory. With zero-shot learning, we see that about 1 in 5 outputs are invalid. However, incorporating examples for few-shot learning resulted in no invalid responses for the BDSI and only 2% invalid responses for the SCS1 across all 10 LLMs. This suggests that for LLM runs for few-shot learning a valid answer is almost always outputted.

We Manuscript submitted to ACM 14 Ali et al. Table 3. Qestions from the SCS1 and BDSI that we included in the expert panel review. Unusual items with high dificulty denote that LLMs performed beter than expected student performance.

SCS1 BDSI High difculty items which LLMs performed well on Low difculty items which LLMs performed poorly on Q15**, 7**, 26** 3, 19 7** 4, 3**, 8 identifed nine unusual items to include in our informal expert panel review, as shown in Table 3. In this section, we note key trends we identifed 3. For the expert panel review, we considered the information relating to item design (learning objective/concept, question type, number of responses, “select one” or “select all that apply,” whether item includes code or images, correct answer, item and all responses), psychometric properties (difculty and discrimination parameters from 2PL model, item trace plots for SCS1 items only), and LLM-related information (number of tokens in input prompt, whether training example was based on item, LLM run responses and correctness). 4.2.1 LLMs performed well on code-infill, poorly on nested conditionals. All three unusual high difculty items for the SCS1 (Q15, 7, 26) were code infll/editing questions which provided a short code segment and required test-takers to fll in two or three gaps in the code with the correct code segments. They assessed the concepts of function return operators (Q15), while loops (Q7), and logical operators (Q26). Only 1-4% of CS1 students would be expected to get each question correct according to the extremely high item difculties (� = 1.77 − 3.11). However 20–45% of LLM runs got these questions correct. One potential explanation is that code infll/editing questions are a particular emphasis in LLM design [34], as evidenced by how GPT-4 (0613) and Llama 2 (7B) with few-shot learning correctly answered all three of these items. Another potential explanation is in how the question structure itself may have implicitly prompted the LLMs to answer these questions as a coding expert, such as how a prompt beginning with “you are an expert programmer” compared to “you are a novice programmer” can result in diferent outputs[106]. LLMs performed poorly on a low difculty SCS1 item involving nested conditionals (SCS1 Q19). This item was relatively difculty (� = 0.74), with an expected 23% of CS1 students getting the item correct. LLMs did worse than this, with only 15% (3/20) of LLM runs getting this question correct: GPT-3.5 Turbo (0613) with few shot learning, GPT-4 (0613) with zero-shot learning, and Mistral v0.1 (7B) with zero-shot learning. Interestingly, both GPT-4 (0613) and Mistral v0.1 (7B) selected the correct response with zero-shot learning, but diferent incorrect responses with few-shot learning. We noticed the same distractor selected by 60% (12/20) of LLM runs, including three of the four most advanced models in their respective families with few shot learning: Anthropic Claude 2.1, Llama 2 (70B), and Mixtral (8x7B 32K seqlen). This distractor option refected the erroneous execution of the outermost else statement despite the corresponding if block already being run. The item trace plot showed that this distractor was never the most commonly selected response option for CS1 students of any knowledge level. Therefore, the LLMs runs clustered towards a distractor that refected a misconception that CS1 students did not often demonstrate. 3To maintain item security, we will not show actual items and will avoid naming correct and incorrect responses. We will mention exact question numbers to support knowledge building about these concept inventories across publications. This reporting practice is consistent with prior work (e.g. [41, 82, 86, 112]) Manuscript submitted to ACM 15 Using Benchmarking Infrastructure to Evaluate LLM Performance on CS Concept Inventories 4.2.2 LLMs clustering towards same distractors. The response pattern for the unusual low difculty item SCS1 Q3 was one that aligned closely with student responses. This question asked test-takers to trace code with a while loop and select the correct output from fve options. Based on the item difculty (� = 0.27), we would expect 39% of CS1 students to get this item correct. Only 25% (5/20) of scenarios outputted the correct response. Comparing LLM responses to the item trace plot revealed that most LLM runs (11/20) outputted the same distractor as the most commonly selected response amongst CS1 students with below average knowledge. These runs were all of smaller/older LLMs (Anthropic Claude v1.3, GPT-3.5 Turbo (0613), Mistral v0.1 (7B) with zero and few shot; Anthropic Claude 2.0 and Llama 2 (7B) with few shot; Llama 2 (13B) with zero shot) with the exception of Llama 2 (70B) with few shot. Only the most advanced models got the correct answer (Anthropic Claude 2.0 and GPT-4 (0613) with zero and few shot, Mixtral (8x7B 32K seqlen) with few shot). This pattern of LLM run outputs closely refected expected CS1 student performance, with smaller LLMs selecting the same distractor as less knowledgeable CS1 students, and larger LLMs selecting the correct answer. For BDSI Q4 (unusual low difculty item), LLMs clustered towards a certain distractor that refected the run time of typical mapping data structures. This item asked test-takers to consider the performance of implementing key-value interface with a linked list. This item was very easy (� = −2.71), with over 99% of CS2 students expected to get it correct. However, only 50% of LLM runs the correct answer (include GPT-4 (0613) and Llama 2 (70B) for both zero and few shot and Anthropic Claude 2.1 with zero shot), with 25% selecting the same distractor (including Anthropic Claude 2.1 with few shot learning and Mixtral (8x7B 32K seqlen) with zero and few shot learning). That distractor refected constant time efciency. LLMs may have selected that distractor because the question described a mapping-like structure (like a hashmap), which typically have constant time lookup. BDSI Q3 (unusual low difculty item) also resulted in LLM runs clustering towards the same distractor with no clear explanation. We considered this question as requiring more creative problem solving because it asked students to identify the best experiment to determine whether a linked list was singly-linked or doubly-linked. It was a very easy item (� = −1.38), with an expected 92% of CS2 students getting it correct. While Llama 2 (70B) and Mixtral (8x7B 32K seqlen) with zero-shot learning were the only two (10%) runs to output the correct response, the same two LLMs with few shot learning were amongst the 50% of runs that selected the same distractor. We could not identify a novice misconception that would lead to selecting that particular distractor. This was even more unusual because we had designed a training item based on the structure of this item, and the answer to the training item was the same as the distractor selected in half of LLM runs. Therefore, the training item could have afected model outputs, but we could not identify an exact explanation as to how. Another explanation for the poor LLM performance could be the extensive question description, which included an interface describing eight methods. This resulted in the item being the longest of all items we evaluated across both the BDSI and SCS1 (2801 tokens). 4.2.3 Modifications of item structure for integration in HELM may have afected dificulty. BDSI Q7 required test-takers to write a function to compute a property of a binary tree. The item was relatively difcult (� = 0.53), with an expected 30% of CS2 students getting this question correct. LLMs performed well on this item with 55% (11/20) of LLM runs outputing the correct answer. A likely explanation was in how we had to change the answer structure to align with HELM capabilities. The original item provided four potential options and required CS2 students to select all that applied. There was only one correct answer though. Because the HELM scenario we used could only allow one correct answer as an output, we efectively changed the structure of the question to prompt the LLMs to select exactly one option (further described in Manuscript submitted to ACM 16 Ali et al. Section 4.3.3). By changing the item from “select all that apply” to “select one,” we reduced the number of valid answer options, potentially explaining why LLMs performed better than expected CS2 students. 4.3 RQ3: Challenges with Automating LLM Benchmarking We answered our third research question by identifying challenges and opportunities with using automated bench\xad marking infrastructure in computing education research. Our goal was to use concept inventories as a benchmark and use the HELM infrastructure to automatically evaluate the performance of current (and hopefully future) LLMs against these CIs. In this section, we describe key challenges to using such a methodology: 4.3.1 Item security and benchmark leakage. Benchmark leakage (as described in Section 2.1.1) is a key concern to CIs because of risks of excessive item exposure. Questions in CIs do not change, so ensuring the security of these questions is crucial to the validity of interpreting and using their results. CI maintainers typically do not publicly post their instruments, instead granting access to their instruments on a case-by-case basis. We therefore assumed that CI items were not part of a training set for any LLMs. However, weak and shifting privacy policies typically enable LLM developers to use past prompts as future training [60, 91, 113, 115]. We describe our processes of gaining consent from CI maintainers and our failed attempts to limit benchmark leakage in Section 3.1. Using CIs as a benchmark opens a “Pandora’s box” whereby we can assume that LLM developers will use CIs as future training data (as unlabeled data at least). 4.3.2 Faithful translation of CI items. As described in Section 3.2, HELM expects data to be passed in as a list of Instance objects, where an Instance represents a question and its associated answers. Typically, this data is prepared by frst obtaining the requisite data set in JSON format, which streamlines the overall process (as well as allows users to take advantage of the many existing examples within HELM). As such, preparing CIs for HELM required us to convert them from their existing forms—generally human-readable PDFs—into JSON format. The difculty here arose from making certain design decisions (see Section 3.2) which allowed us to represent CIs in such a format while ensuring we did not change the spirit of what the authors wished to convey. For example, the BDSI consisted of several questions involving graphs, which we needed to translate into a text representation both suitable for JSON and comprehensible to LLMs. Once these decisions were made, the translation was fairly straightforward, but time consuming. 4.3.3 Limited structure of items. We were limited to multiple-choice questions with single answers in our work, as it was unclear how to test for open-ended responses within HELM. Most directly, this limitation led to the exclusion of the Basic Recursion Concept Inventory [37] in our work, as it is a rare instance of a CI which asks open-ended free-response questions. Additionally, HELM does not currently support questions with multiple correct answers (i.e. “select all that apply” questions), which led to the exclusion of two such questions in the BDSI. 4.3.4 Development of training questions for HELM. While LLMs are popularly associated with more advanced models such as GPT-4 (0613), it is important to remember that not all models are quite so capable. Several models in HELM (such as Mistral v0.1 (7B) and Anthropic Anthropic Claude v1.3, in our work), require example question-answer pairs as few-shot training examples for in-context learning [105] in order to produce answers in the desired format. For most HELM examples, researchers can just take a subset of the existing data set as a training/test split. However, this approach was not suitable for CIs. Unlike other data sets, CIs are already small, and researchers will likely want to learn about LLM performance on all items. Using existing questions as few-shot training examples prevents those questions from being evaluated; thus, researchers must write additional example questions to mimic the structure of CI items. It Manuscript submitted to ACM 17 Using Benchmarking Infrastructure to Evaluate LLM Performance on CS Concept Inventories is worth noting, however, that these questions do not need to be high-quality assessment questions or even directly related to the topic of the CI; they simply need to match the input and output structure of the other questions. 4.3.5 Barriers to accessing and using LLMs within HELM. Firstly, the use of HELM required the preparation of data into a standardized machine-readable format and the use of a custom API, thereby requiring programming knowledge. Though LLM research can sometimes be done within user interfaces, such an approach does not scale for evaluating entire CIs and their individual items. Therefore, APIs must be used. Using a new type of data set for HELM requires researchers to prepare data in a standardized machine-readable format (see 3.2). This work contributes a new Scenario, called CIMCQA, to HELM, which future researchers may take advantage of. However, for other types of questions (e.g. free-response items), researchers will need to author their own Scenarios if they cannot adapt existing one. Furthermore, there are many subtleties within HELM itself that are difcult to navigate but essential to obtaining results. Our research was only made possible because an author was a member of HELM’s research engineering team. Finally, one of the more difcult challenges is obtaining access to all the available models in HELM. LLMs have barriers to access. Most are accessible through closed or limited APIs which users typically must pay for. Open-access LLMs often require owning or renting a CPU or paying for a commercial model interface platform to host the model. These constraints also apply to HELM. HELM users must have their own API keys for every single model they wish to use, a fairly limiting restriction considering the total number of models. These challenges to LLM access stand in the way of using benchmarking infrastructure to support replication of benchmark evaluations on future LLMs. 5 DISCUSSION: UNDERSTANDING OF LLM PERFORMANCE FOR MORE VALID ASSESSMENTS In this paper, we explored the feasibility of using HELM, an automated benchmarking framework, as a methodology to support more reproducible, replicable, and rigorous empirical studies related to large language models (LLMs) in computing education. We evaluated the performance of 10 LLMs with zero and few-shot learning on two CS concept inventories (CIs): the SCS1 [82] to assess introductory computing knowledge, and the BDSI [86] to assess basic data structures knowledge. We found that most LLM runs produced SCS1 responses that aligned with below average introductory computing (CS1) students and BDSI responses that could not be modeled with a 2PL model. In an informal expert review comparing LLM performance to item-level psychometric properties, we found that LLMs performed well on code infl questions, but poorly on questions involving nested conditionals, runtime analysis, and longer question descriptions. We also identifed challenges to our methodology involving CI item security, item translation, and barriers to LLM access. Through an empirical investigation that compares LLM and expected student performance using psychometric data and describes challenges to using HELM, this paper contributes as a feasibility study into the use of automated benchmarking infrastructure as a methodological innovation to computing education research. In this section, we interpret our fndings as they relate to the roles of LLMs in the iterative process of assessment design in computing education. We specifcally consider the implications of using automated benchmarking infrastructure to investigate the rapidly evolving intersections of LLM capabilities, computing concepts, and assessment design. 5.1 Limitations and Threats to Validity One interpretation of our study is that it sufers from limitations and threats to validity that invalidate our fndings. This is of particular concern as we investigate the feasibility of a new methodology. Our study sufers from convenience sampling of LLMs to include. We included 10 LLMs from 4 diferent organizations because we had access to their APIs. While these LLMs are popular and widely used at the time of our studies and prior Manuscript submitted to ACM 18 Ali et al. evaluations of LLMs typically consider fewer LLMs (e.g. [29, 56, 66, 98]), our fndings are limited to the LLMs in this set. While they enable us to make hypotheses about how other LLMs might perform on the SCS1 and BDSI, we rely on future work to conduct hypothesis-driven studies that could yield more defnitive claims. Furthermore, the HELM infrastructure makes evaluation of these CI items on additional LLMs more reliable, thus supporting replication of this study. A threat to validity relates to the choices we made while translating CI items (particularly code and images) into the text passed into HELM. While we cannot make the example prompts we passed in public to maintain some level of item security, we attempted to be transparent in our design decisions in Section 3.2. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that some design decisions caused LLMs to interpret a CI item diferently from how a student may interpret the original item, thus confounding our results. One example of this is how we changed a “select all that apply” item to a “select one” item to make it compatible with HELM infrastructure, as described in Section 4.2.3. Another threat to validity is in our modeling of LLM responses as independent test-takers. Item Response Theory assumes that test-takers are providing responses independently of each other [19]. We make this assumption while recognizing that all 10 LLMs were created by four organizations. Furthermore, we attempt to model LLM runs as test-takers and measure their knowledge levels, �. We checked for adequate ft to the psychometric models prior to reporting knowledge levels. We also used few-shot learning to reduce the number of invalid (and therefore incorrect) LLM responses to almost zero. Section 4.1 fully describes these checks that we conducted to ensure more valid comparison of LLM responses to expected student responses. We also acknowledge that our informal expert review panel might have led to potentially biased results. We aim for this work to act as a pilot that sets the stage for future work with a larger panel and formally established methodology [73]. A fnal threat to validity is that benchmark leakage will invalidate future automated benchmarks. We should expect that LLMs may incorporate the CIs used for the benchmarks into their training data. This is currently an unavoidable risk, however, since few LLMs provide the facility to prevent leakage, and benchmarking cannot be done without passing in the data. Future work can investigate the use of techniques to mitigate and detect benchmark leakage [60, 91, 115]. 5.2 Automating Closed-Ended Evaluations for Reproducibility and Replicability Another interpretation of our fndings is that the use of automated benchmarking infrastructure supports more reproducible and replicable evaluations of LLM performance on tasks related to computing education. As stated in Section 2.1, it is easier to automate more closed-ended tasks with clear measures of correctness, such as multiple-choice questions in CIs. While benchmarks are usually shared publicly, this should not occur to ensure the item security of CI items. Before a CI can actually be passed into an LLM, it must be translated efectively into a format that a language model can interpret. It is well documented that prompting LLMs in certain ways can change the output [87, 106], and this extends to the CI questions themselves, because they become part of the prompt. While we documented our design decisions to aid replicability, we do not suggest our design decisions were ideal. The possibility remains that an alternative translation may have made greater sense to LLMs, or better enable them to mimic actual students. We identify this as a potential area of future work. Our use of HELM helped address a key confound to evaluating LLM performance in assessments: determining correctness. Mahon et al. [68] identifed how a majority of ChatGPT’s incorrect responses to multiple choice questions involved ChatGPT outputting correct explanations, but incorrect or invalid outputs. Our use of HELM’s few shot Manuscript submitted to ACM 19 Using Benchmarking Infrastructure to Evaluate LLM Performance on CS Concept Inventories in-context learning functionality reduced the number of invalid responses to 0-2% (Table 2), thereby almost eliminating the confound of LLMs producing an invalid response. Furthermore, sensitivity to prompt structure is a likely explanation for LLMs outputting incorrect responses despite correct explanations [49, 68]. Frameworks such as HELM can help address this by enabling more consistent and reusable structures of input prompts of LLMs. In our study, we developed the CIMCQA Scenario to do this (see Section 3.2), which future work can interrogate, utilize, and/or adapt. This transparent and more consistent prompt structuring can support more reproducible evaluations. Furthermore, HELM’s continuous integration of new LLMs drastically reduces the barriers to future work that replicates previous evaluations on new LLMs, a key challenge to LLM research in computing education moving forward [87]. Taking a broader perspective, accessing and running more LLMs with HELM is perhaps the most pressing research challenge. More ambitious future work could involve extending this methodology to benchmark and evaluate all CIs with validity evidence against all common and modern LLMs in HELM. Though HELM provides the framework needed to carry out this work, it does not by default provide the monetary resources, as users must provide possess independent access for any model they desire to use. With the large number of LLMs available in HELM and at least 14 computing CIs with validity evidence [3, 41], the amount of resources needed is potentially best suited for a team of collaborative researchers. A key implication of automated benchmarking infrastructure for reproducible and replicable computing education research is the investigation of hypotheses at the intersection of LLM capabilities, item design, and computing concepts. For example, our informal expert panel review (Section 4.2.1) identifed that LLMs performed poorly on a low difculty SCS1 question that CS1 students performed well on. This item involved tracing pseudocode which contained a nested conditional. We generated multiple explanations as to why LLM performance deviated from expected student performance, including aspects of the item design (LLMs may struggle to parse the pseudocode) or computing concepts being assessed (LLMs may struggle with nested conditionals). A computing education researcher or practitioner could feasibly investigate these hypotheses by designing items to explore each one (e.g. a pool of equivalent items in the pseudocode and other programming languages to determine LLM sensitivity to programming language, and a pool of diferent items assessing nested conditionals in the same programming language to determine LLM sensitivity to a computing concept). They could then use automated benchmarking infrastructure such as HELM to efectively control for confounding variables (e.g. prompt structure, determining correctness, etc.) when evaluating performance of diferent LLMs, thus supporting reproducibility. Crucially, they could also control for these confounds when evaluating new LLMs, thus supporting replicability. 5.3 Mixed-Methods Evaluations for Rigor A fnal interpretation of our fndings is that applying mixed-methods to connect LLM outputs with additional informa\xad tion such as psychometric evidence provides more rigorous investigations into the intersection of LLM capabilities, assessment design, and computing concepts. For LLM runs with response patterns that ft the CI’s 2PL models, we found that LLMs refected knowledge of below average introductory CS knowledge but of above average data structures knowledge (see Section 4.1). We would not expect this pattern with any students because introductory CS knowledge is taught before and is typically considered pre-requisite knowledge to data structures. Future work can investigate whether this pattern is consistent and why this may be the case. Existing psychometric data enabled our informal expert panel review to compare LLM responses to expected student responses. The use of concept inventories as benchmarks with existing validity evidence enabled more rigorous Manuscript submitted to ACM 20 Ali et al. evaluations. Furthermore, because concept inventories are specifcally designed to identify student misconceptions, it was easier to pinpoint what exact topics LLMs struggled with when evaluating our results. This is a key diference between our benchmarking work as compared with prior work, which often used summative assessments from courses [96] or standardized assessments which may have validity evidence, but lack the structure and transparency of concept inventories to enable identifcation of misconceptions for specifc concepts [49, 68]. In particular, we used item trace plots from Xie et al. [112] to consider whether LLMs and CS1 students of diferent knowledge levels selected similar or diferent distractors for the SCS1. This served as a key signal to identify whether LLM outputs refected common student misconceptions (clustering towards similar distractors). When LLMs clustered towards uncommon distractors, we developed hypotheses related to item design, LLM design, and computing concepts, as described in Section 4.2. Mixed-methods future work could further explore these hypotheses to inform the design of computing pedagogy and assessment that are more resilient to changing LLM capabilities. Such future work could follow a similar mixed-methods approach by designing new items to benchmark, evaluating them with students and/or LLMs (using automated benchmarking infrastructure), and then conducting qualitative follow-up investigations with domain experts and students to better understand patterns. Future work could also investigate student perspectives on unusual items. Cognitive Interviews [27] with students in the target population could provide a more clear understanding of students’ thought processes when answering questions, as well as new hypotheses on why LLMs perform diferently than students on given items. A key implication of more rigorous evaluations with automated benchmarking infrastructure is the opportunity for LLM-aided assessment design. Prior work in computing education has found that LLMs perform well on many programming tasks [1, 57, 65, 81, 87]. This is in part because LLM developers train their models on vast repositories of openly available code (e.g. GitHub) and have fnancial incentive to support programming tasks (e.g. code infll [34]). Therefore, LLM advancements will likely make the design of computing assessments particularly more challenging. Automated benchmarking infrastructure may be able to support assessment designers by simulating students to gauge item difculty and/or using psychometric evidence to iteratively design more LLM-resilient items. Future work may also investigate the potential for LLMs to support automating aspects of item generation [47, 95], such as by generating informative distractors for multiple choice items [55, 69] or developing parallel items with similar difculty [47]. 6 CONCLUSION In this paper, we described our process in efciently and systematically evaluating LLM performance on computing education assessments with validity evidence. It is our hope that our work can contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of LLMs on assessing students, as well as set the foundation for future work that can inform instructors in designing assessments that are more resilient against completion by LLMs. Given the growing waves of LLMs and Generative AI tools, we want to acknowledge that advancements of LLMs do not necessarily translate to equitable benefts to students [12, 32, 67, 108]; assessments are not perfect or all-encompassing measures of learning [4, 75, 76]; and not all facets of computing are well-represented in AI tools [68, 87]. Therefore, we hope that computing education can leverage automated benchmarking infrastructure to encourage more cross-disciplinary, human-centered, and enduring investigations at the intersections of LLM capabilities, assessment design, and computing concepts in computing education.

From business and education to research and creativity, this form of artificial intelligence (AI) automates complex tasks, streamlines processes, and enhances user and organizational experiences. The adaptability of LLM applications across multiple contexts makes them strategic, versatile tools for all kinds of industries.\n\nIn this post, we explore LLM applications across different industrial sectors, their advantages and limitations, and their growing role in logistics and warehouse management.\n\n## What are LLMs and how are they used in industry?\n\nLLM stands for **large language model**, which is an AI system trained on vast amounts of text using machine learning techniques, specifically deep neural networks. The goal of LLM applications is to perform a wide range of tasks, from recognizing patterns and understanding language to producing coherent responses.\n\nThese models represent a major leap forward in AI because they process language much like humans do: answering questions, translating, summarizing information, writing long texts, or even generating code. Today, users and companies alike can access LLM applications through tools such as **ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini**. Their versatility explains why organizations in many sectors are eager to integrate them into daily operations.\n\nIn **business and industry**, applications of LLMs support everything from **customer service** (through round-the-clock automated assistance) to content creation. They also enhance **corporate training** by simulating real-life scenarios to improve communication and problem-solving skills. In e-commerce, they personalize the customer experience with tailored recommendations. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, they enable [predictive maintenance](/blog/predictive-maintenance) and process optimization by interpreting data from sensors and equipment.\n\n## Benefits of using LLMs in industry\n\nLLM applications offer clear advantages for organizations looking to automate language-related tasks such as content generation, document analysis, and customer communications.\n\nKey benefits include:\n\n* **Decision-making support**. LLMs help analyze massive datasets and summarize them into actionable insights, allowing companies to identify trends, risks, and opportunities. While they don’t replace human judgment, they strengthen strategic decisions with richer, more accessible data.\n* **Process optimization**. When combined with sensor data, technical reports, or operational records, LLMs interpret information, uncovering patterns and anomalies. This supports early issue detection and process planning, leading to faster, more cost-efficient operations.\n* **Higher productivity**. By generating text and code, LLM applications free professionals from repetitive tasks so they can focus on solving complex challenges and driving innovation.\n* **Scalability and efficiency**. LLMs process large volumes of information and lengthy documents simultaneously, helping organizations handle workload peaks and grow sustainably.\n\nBeyond process optimization and cost reduction, LLM applications are redefining how companies innovate. By automating repetitive tasks, they enable professionals to concentrate on higher-value, creative work.\n\n## Limitations of LLM applications\n\nWhile industrial applications of large language models unlock enormous potential across sectors, understanding their limits is essential for using them responsibly:\n\n* **Hallucinations**. LLM applications may “see” patterns or connections that don’t exist, generating inaccurate or fabricated information that may sound convincing but lacks factual basis.\n* **Bias**. Because they learn from real-world data, LLMs can inherit existing biases, leading to outputs that reinforce stereotypes or exclude certain social groups.\n* **Privacy**. There’s a risk that applications of large language models might reproduce fragments of confidential data used during training, unintentionally revealing sensitive information.\n* **Limited reasoning**. LLMs are not autonomous thinkers. They generate text based on patterns, requiring human oversight to validate outputs and ensure they align with organizational goals.\n\nThese challenges affect logistics and supply chain management, in particular. A [study from the University of Cambridge](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ge-Zheng-7/publication/386414179_LLMs_in_Supply_Chain_Management_Opportunities_and_Case_Study/links/6750464aa7fbc259f1ac7eae/LLMs-in-Supply-Chain-Management-Opportunities-and-Case-Study.pdf) found that general-purpose models like [ChatGPT](/blog/chatgpt-supply-chain) aren’t always effective in business contexts. Since they lack company-specific knowledge, their answers can be incomplete or irrelevant. The researchers suggest developing custom models trained on internal data for more accurate results. However, this requires significant data volumes and computing power. Despite the challenges, ongoing research and specialized tools show that industrial LLM integration is becoming increasingly feasible.\n\n## Common applications of LLMs\n\nLarge language models have countless practical uses that are already changing how people and organizations work, learn, and communicate. To harness their full potential, it’s critical to understand [how to use artificial intelligence](/blog/how-to-use-artificial-intelligence):\n\n* **Data analysis and insights**. LLM applications can adapt to different types of language and formats. They extract relevant information from unstructured data — even from loosely formatted documents — recognize key entities, and take into account the context in which they appear.\n* **Automated internal communication**. LLM applications streamline queries in HR (leave policies and payroll) and IT (troubleshooting and account setup). They also help standardize templates and newsletters, maintaining a consistent tone across internal communications.\n* **Programming assistance**. LLMs support software developers by suggesting code snippets, detecting errors, and proposing solutions. They adapt to different programming languages and offer contextualized recommendations, speeding up development.\n* **Virtual assistance**. These systems power conversational assistants that answer customer questions, perform internal tasks, and deliver clear, natural-language information. Their integration into self-service solutions enhances the customer experience.\n* **Technical documentation and content generation**. Through user prompts, LLM applications can draft texts in multiple formats and styles, improving contextual relevance and reducing repetitive work.\n* **Translation and localization**. LLMs translate between languages and analyze large text datasets — such as customer feedback and internal documentation — fostering faster, more efficient global communication.\n\n## LLM examples by industry\n\nLLMs are making waves in diverse sectors, adapting to each one’s unique challenges and workflows. These examples of LLMs in different industries show how AI is transforming how we work, learn, produce, and consume.\n\n* **Automotive**. A study by the [University of Stuttgart’s Institute of Automotive Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827125004639), in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz AG, shows how LLM applications can play a crucial role in software development for vehicle manufacturing. They help anticipate the impact of updates and shorter release cycles on assembly lines, maintaining product quality and improving coordination between software and production teams. While manual validation and sophisticated evaluation methods are still necessary, this approach promises greater process stability and tighter integration between digital innovation and manufacturing.\n* **Ecommerce**. A paper by [Brandeis University’s Michtom School of Computer Science and eBay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12779) indicates that LLMs are already employed for tasks such as generating product descriptions, summarizing reviews, expanding search queries, and managing buyer-seller inquiries. They also detect consumer trends, fine-tune merchandise management, and offer personalized recommendations, improving both the customer experience and operational efficiency.\n* **Manufacturing**. Research by [MIT, in collaboration with Harvard and the University of Washington](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14377), highlights how LLM applications can support the entire product design and manufacturing process. These tools can transform ideas expressed in natural language into technical specifications, generate design variations, translate them into machine instructions, and even estimate product performance. The study revealed that LLM applications can accelerate the creation of prototypes and shorten the gap between the initial idea and the physical product. Nevertheless, the MIT experts caution that there are still limitations — as in the case of geometrically complex designs — so LLMs should be combined with human expertise and specialized tools.\n* **Chemicals**. [Carnegie Mellon University](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20921) researchers demonstrated how LLM technology can optimize chemical processes. Traditionally, this required complex calculations as well as full knowledge of operating conditions, which isn’t always possible. The new approach uses multiple LLM-based agents that collaborate to propose operating limits and automatically identify optimal parameters. This opens the door to applying these techniques in existing chemical plants and new processes, reducing costs and accelerating innovation.\n\n## LLM applications in logistics\n\nLogistics is a natural fit for LLMs: wherever data and decisions converge, these models can add value. Implementing [AI in warehouse management](/blog/ai-in-warehouse-management) helps optimize workflows, prevent incidents, and support real-time decision-making.\n\nA study from [MIT’s Sloan School of Management](https://executive.mit.edu/blog/the-future-of-supply-chain-planning-faster-smarter-decisions-with-llms.html) points out that digital technologies are changing how supply chain decisions are made. Still, logistics professionals often need expert support to interpret system recommendations or run what-if analyses. With LLMs, that process can happen in seconds instead of hours or days, boosting operational efficiency.\n\nCompanies can implement LLM technology to enhance logistics processes through:\n\n* **Data analysis**. LLM applications allow natural-language queries such as “What happens if demand changes?” or “Which contracts should I review?” The system pulls from internal data and returns clear answers without disclosing sensitive information.\n* **Scenario simulation**. Supply chain planning often calls for evaluating hypothetical situations — demand surges, production interruptions, or price shifts. LLMs convert these queries into calculations and generate easy-to-understand explanations that support decision-making.\n* **Real-time management**. When an issue arises — for example, deciding where to allocate inventory — users simply describe the situation in plain language. The LLM tool adjusts the calculations and proposes alternative plans in a format accessible to non-technical teams.\n\nA practical example of an LLM use case in logistics is Interlake Mecalux’s [Easy\xa0AI](/software/updates/generative-ai), integrated into the [Easy\xa0WMS warehouse management system](/software/wms-warehouse-management-system). Through its chat interface, users can ask complex questions in seven languages. They can query warehouse data in natural language and receive responses in various formats (figures, tables, or charts), create custom KPI dashboards, generate downloadable reports, design on-demand data views, and perform specific actions such as releasing rush orders and unlocking aisles. This integration helps companies speed up their facility operations and processes and access information more efficiently.\n\n## LLM applications in industry: Building smarter operations\n\nThe rapid growth in LLM usage reflects how organizations are embracing these tools to change how they access, interpret, and utilize information. Their ability to turn data into practical knowledge is enabling **faster, more accurate operations**. But successful adoption requires awareness of LLM limitations — such as potential bias or factual errors — and careful human oversight.\n\nIn logistics, LLM applications have **tremendous potential** in everything from inventory optimization to real-time reporting that supports better decisions. Solutions like Interlake Mecalux’s Easy\xa0AI show that the key lies in purpose-built tools designed for warehouse needs. The future points toward an industrial landscape where AI complements — rather than replaces — human teams, driving productivity and resilience across the board.\n\n## LLM applications in 5 questions\n\n### What are LLMs?\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on massive volumes of text.

site]](#)\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are powerful models reshaping how we interact with machines. According to [recent HBR research](https://hbr.org/2024/09/embracing-gen-ai-at-work), more than 40% of all U.S. work activity can be augmented or automated, allowing businesses to streamline operations, automate mundane tasks, and uncover deep insights faster than ever.\n\nGone are the days when AI's responses were rigid and predictable. Now, LLMs can create content, write stories, solve complex problems, and even mimic human-like conversations with uncanny accuracy.\n\nBelow, we'll walk you through all the top LLM use cases and applications in 2024.\n\n## What is an LLM (and what do you use it for)?\n\n[Large Language Models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/introduction-large-language-models-generative-ai) are AI systems that understand and generate human language at scale by learning patterns from vast text datasets. These models excel at tasks like content creation, language translation, and complex reasoning by predicting contextually appropriate responses to user prompts.\n\nLLMs have shifted how we approach information, communication, and creativity. Their development from basic models to complex systems like GPT-4 illustrates a growing capacity that stretches beyond mere text processing to encompass a broad spectrum of applications:\n\n* **Versatility of applications:** Apart from being good at simple tasks, LLMs can achieve varied tasks on natural language like text generation and summarization and eventually be used for applications in medical or legal areas.\n* **Human productivity boost:** LLMs free up valuable time for creative and strategic thinking. As noted in [a recent market survey](https://www.assemblyai.com/2025-research-report), by streamlining tasks like content creation and data analysis through automated workflows, LLMs help increase productivity and allow for more focus on revenue-driving outputs.\n* **Accessibility:** LLMs serve as a bridge between the vast amounts of data available and actionable insights (making information more accessible and manageable).\n* **Interactivity at scale:** LLMs lend themselves well to creating interactive tools and have given rise to advanced chatbots, virtual assistants, and educational tools.

Here are some of the key limitations:\n\n1. Lack of Understanding: Despite their ability to generate human-like text, LLMs do not truly understand the content they process. They rely on patterns in the data rather than genuine comprehension, which can lead to plausible but incorrect or nonsensical outputs.\n2. Bias and Fairness: LLMs can inherit and amplify biases present in the data they are trained on. If the training data includes biased or prejudiced language, the model might produce outputs that reflect these biases, leading to ethical concerns and potentially harmful outcomes.\n3. Over-reliance on Training Data: LLMs are only as good as the data they are trained on. They lack real-time knowledge and cannot update their understanding of the world beyond what they have seen during training, which can result in outdated or incorrect information.\n4. Difficulty with Complex Reasoning: While LLMs can handle simple reasoning tasks, they struggle with complex logical reasoning and problem-solving that require deep understanding and integration of diverse concepts.\n5. Resource Intensive: Training and deploying LLMs require significant computational resources and energy, which can be costly and environmentally impactful. This can limit access to such technology to well-funded organizations and create barriers for smaller entities.\n6. Potential for Misuse: LLMs can be used to generate misleading or harmful content, such as deepfakes, disinformation, and automated spam. Their ability to produce convincing text raises concerns about misuse and the spread of false information.\n7. Limited Contextual Awareness: While LLMs can process and generate text based on a given context, they may lose coherence in longer texts or complex dialogues that require maintaining context over multiple interactions.\n8. Dependence on User Input: The quality of an LLM's output is highly dependent on the quality of the input prompt. Ambiguous or poorly structured prompts can lead to unsatisfactory responses.\n9. Ethical and Legal Concerns: The use of LLMs raises questions about intellectual property rights, privacy, and accountability, especially when they are used to generate content based on copyrighted materials or personal data.\n10.

Understanding these limitations is crucial for deploying LLMs responsibly and effectively.\n\n## How LLM Learns: with Charlie the Computer (AI Simplified Series)\n\n## How are LLMs trained?\n\nTraining large language models (LLMs) involves several steps and techniques designed to enable these models to understand and generate human-like text. Here’s an overview of the process:\n\n1. Data Collection: The first step in training an LLM is collecting a vast and diverse dataset. This dataset typically includes text from a wide range of sources, such as books, articles, websites, and social media. The goal is to gather enough data to cover various topics, writing styles, and contexts to make the model versatile in understanding language.\n2. Data Preprocessing: Once the data is collected, it is preprocessed to make it suitable for training. This involves cleaning the data by removing irrelevant content, formatting the text uniformly, tokenizing the text into smaller units (such as words or subwords), and creating input-output pairs that the model will learn from.\n3. Model Architecture: LLMs are typically based on neural network architectures, such as transformers. The transformer architecture is particularly popular for LLMs because it can process large amounts of data efficiently and capture long-range dependencies in text through mechanisms like self-attention.\n4. Training Process: The training process involves feeding the preprocessed data into the model and adjusting the model’s parameters to minimize the difference between the model’s predictions and the actual data. This is done through a process called backpropagation, which adjusts the weights of the neural network based on the errors in predictions.\n   1. Unsupervised Pre-training: LLMs are often pre-trained using unsupervised learning on large datasets. The model learns to predict the next word in a sentence or fill in missing words, which helps it understand language structure and context.\n   2. Fine-tuning: After pre-training, the model may be fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset. Fine-tuning helps the model adapt to specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or question answering, by focusing on examples relevant to those tasks.\n5. Evaluation and Iteration: Throughout the training process, the model’s performance is evaluated on validation datasets. These datasets are separate from the training data and help assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. Based on the evaluation results, the model may be adjusted or further trained to improve performance.\n6. Hyperparameter Tuning: During training, various hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and model size, are adjusted to optimize performance. Hyperparameter tuning is often done through experimentation and can significantly impact the model’s effectiveness.\n7. Deployment: Once trained and evaluated, the model is deployed for use in applications. During deployment, additional techniques like pruning, quantization, or distillation might be used to make the model more efficient and reduce computational requirements.\n8. Training LLMs requires substantial computational resources and time due to the complexity and size of these models. However, the result is a powerful language model capable of understanding and generating text across a wide range of applications.\n\nLast modified\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |"), SearchResult(url='https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-are-large-language-models-llms', title='What are large language models (LLMs)?', raw_content="This is the Trace Id: 10e1eca4648276e60c9ae2e4298a3915   \n\n[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) \n\n[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us)\n\n# What are large language models (LLMs)?\n\nGet an overview of how LLMs work—and explore how they are used to build AI-powered solutions.\n\n[Explore the Azure model catalog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-model-catalog)   [Get started with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account)\n\n## LLM meaning\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems that understand and generate natural language, or human-like text, using the data they’ve been trained on through [machine learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-machine-learning-platform/) techniques. LLMs can automatically generate text-based content, which can be applied to a myriad of uses cases across industries, resulting in greater efficiencies and cost savings for organizations worldwide.\n\n### Key takeaways\n\n* LLMs are advanced AI systems that can understand and generate natural language.\n* LLMs rely on deep learning architectures and machine learning techniques to process and incorporate information from different data sources.\n* LLMs bring major benefits, such as language generation and translation, to a diverse set of fields.\n* Though they are groundbreaking, LLMs face challenges that may include computational requirements, ethical concerns, and limitations in understanding context.\n* Despite these challenges, organizations are already using the generative pretrained transformers (GPT) series and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for tasks such as content creation, chatbots, translation, and sentiment analysis.\n\n## How does an LLM work?\n\n### Brief history of LLMs\n\n> LLMs are a modern-day development, but the study of natural language processing (NLP) dates to 1950, when Alan Turing launched the Turing test to gauge intelligent behavior among machines. In the test, a human judge speaks to a computer using a set of questions—and must determine if they are speaking to a machine or a human.\n\n> By the 1980s and 1990s, NLP shifted away from logic experiments toward a more data-driven approach. With their ability to predict which words in a sentence were likely to come next based on the words before them, statistical language models, such as n-grams, paved the way for a new era. By the early 2010s, newer neural networks expanded the capabilities of these language models even further, allowing them to move beyond determining the order of words toward a deeper understanding of the representation and meaning of words.\n\n> These new developments culminated in a breakthrough in 2018, when eight Google scientists penned and published “Attention is All You Need,” a landmark study on machine learning. Most notably, the paper introduced the transformer architecture, an innovative neural network framework that could manage and understand complex textual information with greater accuracy and scale. Transformers are now foundational to some of today’s most powerful LLMs, including the GPT series, as well as BERT.\n\n### Basic architecture\n\n> Today’s state-of-the-art LLMs use [deep learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-deep-learning/) architectures like transformers and other deep neural network frameworks to process information from different data sources. Transformers are especially effective at handling sequential data, such as text, which allows them to understand and generate natural language for tasks such as language generation and translation.\n\n> Transformers consist of two primary components: encoders and decoders. These components often work together to process and generate sequences. The encoder takes raw textual data and turns that input into discrete elements that can be analyzed by the model. The decoder then processes that data through a series of layers to produce the final output, which may, for instance, consist of a generated sentence. Transformers can also consist of encoders or decoders only, depending on the type of model or task.\n\n### Training process\n\n> The training process for LLMs consists of three main stages: data collection, model training, and fine-tuning.\n\n> During the data collection phase, the model is exposed to large volumes of textual data from a wide variety of sources, including Internet resources, books, articles, and databases. The data is also cleaned, processed, standardized, and stored in a [NoSQL database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-nosql-database) so that it can be used to train the model on language patterns, grammar, information, and context.\xa0\n\n> In the pre-training phase, the model starts to build an understanding of the language in the data. This is accomplished through large-scale, unsupervised tasks where the model learns to predict text based on its context. Some techniques include autoregressive modeling, where the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence, as well as masked language modeling, where the model fills in masked words to understand the context.\xa0\n\n> Lastly, during the fine-tuning phase, the model is further trained on a smaller, more task-specific dataset. This process refines the model's knowledge and enhances its performance for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or translation, so that it can be used for a variety of applications.\n\n### Key components\n\n> The transformer model breaks raw text down into smaller, basic units of text called tokens. Tokens may consist of words, parts of words, or even individual characters, depending on the use case. These tokens are then converted into dense numerical representations that capture order, semantic meaning, and context. These representations, called embeddings, are then passed through a stack of layers consisting of two sub-layers: self-attention and neural networks.\n\n> While both layers assist in converting text into a form that the model can process effectively, the self-attention mechanism is a key component to the transformer architecture. The self-attention mechanism is what permits the model to home in on different parts of a text sequence and dynamically weigh the value of information relative to other tokens in the sequence, regardless of their position. This mechanism is also what gives LLMs the capacity to capture the intricate dependencies, relationships, and contextual nuances of written language.\n\n## Benefits and challenges\n\n### Benefits\n\nLLMs offer many benefits that have contributed to significant advancements in work and society.\n\n### Improved language generation and translation\n\n> Because LLMs can understand and capture the nuanced relationships between words, they excel at producing natural, human-like text, resulting in improved language generation. They can fluently and consistently generate creative, contextually appropriate responses, and they can do so in various formats, including novels.\n\n> Since they can contextualize and find subtleties in meaning, LLMs that are trained on multilingual data can also perform highly accurate translations. Training a model on a specific set of languages can help them fine-tune their ability to handle idioms, expressions, and other complex linguistic features, resulting in translations that feel organic and fluent.\n\n### Applications in diverse fields\n\n> LLMs are versatile tools that have many applications across many fields, including healthcare, finance, and customer service.\n\nIn healthcare, LLMs can:\xa0  \n\n* Analyze patient reports for possible conditions and provide preliminary diagnoses.\n\n* Generate patient notes and discharge summaries, in turn streamlining administrative tasks.\n\n* Suggest personalized treatment plans and medical care based on patient history.\n\n\xa0 In the finance sector, LLMs can:\n\n* Identify unusual activity across financial data that may point to fraud.\n\n* Assess financial risks by analyzing market trends and financial reports.\n\n* Suggest personalized recommendations based on your unique financial history and goals.\n\n\xa0 In customer service, LLMs can:\n\n* Drive automated customer support through conversational agents and chatbots.\n\n* Expand the scope of an organization’s service by providing customers with all-day support.\n\n* Help create and update documentation by generating content based on common questions.\n\n### Challenges\n\nLLMs offer crucial benefits, but they also come with challenges to consider.\n\n### Computational and energy requirements\n\n> While LLMs are powerful, they require substantial amounts of computational resources, storage, and energy consumption to operate. During training, transformers scale with the length of the input sequence, so the longer the text, the more memory you’ll need. Not only are these demands expensive, but they also emit a significant amount of carbon into the environment.\n\n> [Cloud computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-computing/) platforms can support the heavy computational load of LLMs by providing flexible, scalable infrastructure, making it more accessible for organizations to start developing their own models. Still, the environmental impact of LLMs pose a challenge and is indicative of a need for more energy-efficient models and techniques.\n\n### Ethical concerns (e.g., bias, misinformation)\n\n> LLMs are only as good as the data they are trained on. If there is discriminatory bias against certain groups in the training data, then the model will highlight these attitudes. Identifying and mitigating these biases so that the model remains fair is an ongoing task, one that requires frequent and consistent human monitoring.\n\n> LLMs can also produce compelling but factually misleading information, resulting in the spread of misinformation, fake news, phishing emails, and other forms of harmful content. Content moderation guidelines can also vary across regions, which makes them difficult to navigate around. As a result, many organizations may find it challenging to build and maintain trust in their users when introducing LLMs to their business operations.\n\n### Limitations in understanding context and nuance\n\n> While LLMs excel at identifying patterns in language, they can still struggle with new or unknown contexts that require more nuanced understanding. As a result, LLMs trained on sensitive, proprietary data may accidentally generate or reveal confidential information from their training data.\n\n> Addressing this issue can pose a significant challenge, especially since the internal workings of LLMs often lack transparency. This can contribute to an overall lack of accountability, as well as issues around trust-building.\n\n## Types and use cases\n\n### GPT series\n\n> First developed by OpenAI in 2018, the GPT series introduced the foundational concept of data collection, pretraining, and fine-tuning to LLMs. GPT-2, released in 2019, significantly scaled up the model’s capabilities and improved its ability to generate more contextually relevant language. GPT-3 advanced the model’s capacity for handling complex prompts and tasks. The latest iteration, GPT-4, was released in 2023 and provides even more accurate and nuanced responses to prompts—while also addressing some of the model’s previous challenges, including bias.\n\n> Today, GPT continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the field of natural language generation. Each model in the series builds upon the previous one, driving AI-powered innovation forward.\n\n### BERT and its variants\n\nDeveloped by Google in 2018, BERT is a groundbreaking model that has set the standard for what’s possible with LLMs. Unlike the GPT series, which processes text in a unidirectional manner (from left-to-right or right-to-left), BERT takes on a bidirectional approach. A bidirectional model processes the context of each word from both directions simultaneously, which allows BERT to perform masked language modeling in addition to next-sentence predictions. Researchers have also contributed to further advancements in the field by fine-tuning BERT on tasks such as sentiment analysis, setting new benchmarks as a result.\n\n### Other notable models\n\n> Developed by Facebook AI in 2019, Robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa) is a variant of the BERT model that expands on BERT's bidirectional transformer architecture by optimizing the pretraining process. RoBERTa is trained with a larger data set, and for longer. It also focuses solely on masked language modeling. This allows RoBERTa to demonstrate its robust ability to capture context and nuances.\n\n> Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5), which was invented by Google Research, is another notable LLM. Like traditional models, T5 is built on the transformer architecture and uses encoders and decoders to process text during the pretraining phase. Unlike traditional models, T5 treats both the inputs and outputs as text strings, simplifying the architecture and streamlining the training process. T5 models are an adaptable general-purpose model that can handle a versatile range of tasks.\n\n### Content creation and summarization\n\n> LLMs can generate engaging, informative, and contextually appropriate content in a variety of styles and formats. When prompted, they can generate articles, reports, blog posts, emails, marketing copy, and even code snippets.\n\n> When it comes to summaries, LLMs stand out in their unique ability to distill large volumes of text into concise and accurate snapshots. They can present key points while still maintaining the original context and meaning of the original content. Researchers are already saving time and boosting productivity by using LLMs to summarize research papers, articles, presentations, and meeting notes.\n\n### Conversational agents and chatbots\n\n> Conversational agents and chatbots rely on the advanced natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to generate human-like interactions. They interpret user inputs and respond in a fluent, natural, and contextually relevant manner. Not only can they answer questions, but they can also engage in long and complex dialogue.\n\n> With the addition of chatbots and virtual assistants, businesses can now provide round-the-clock support to their customers, in turn expanding their service availability, improving response times, and increasing overall customer satisfaction.\n\n### Language translation and sentiment analysis\n\n> LLMs that are extensively trained on multilingual datasets produce highly accurate translations across various languages. Unlike traditional models, LLMs can capture the subtleties and complexities of language, such as idiomatic expressions, resulting in translations that are both fluent and contextually appropriate.\n\n> LLMs are also able to perform sentiment analysis, which analyzes the underlying emotional tone of a text. By processing and interpreting the subtleties of language, LLMs provide more precise and insightful sentiment evaluations. They can even detect more nuanced sentiments, such as sarcasm.\n\n### Personalized recommendations\n\n> LLMs can analyze user data, including user history and preferences, and generate personalized, tailored recommendations that reflect the user's interests and needs, in turn enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n> This capability is widely used across e-commerce, content streaming, and social media, where delivering tailored recommendations drives more meaningful interactions. LLMs can also be used as an educational tool by providing personalized learning experiences to students.\n\n## What’s next\n\n> As researchers continue to improve their understanding, efficiency, and scalability, LLMs are expected to become even more adept at handling complex language tasks. With the adoption of LLMs on the rise, more and more organizations will be experiencing streamlined automation, greater personalization, and better decision-making processes overall.\n\n> Researchers are continuing to explore new ways of addressing bias, an ongoing issue. These include debiasing algorithms that tackle bias during training, incorporating synthetic data that can rebalance datasets to reflect fairness, explainability tools to better understand model decisions, and detection benchmarks that help identify and quantify bias more precisely.\n\n> Multimodal models, which process text, image, audio, and video data, are also becoming more and more sophisticated. While LLMs process textual data by evaluating syntax and meaning, multimodal models analyze visual data through [computer vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-computer-vision/) techniques, as well as audio data through temporal processing.Top of Form Multimodal models are enhancing today’s technologies while also paving the way for the innovations of tomorrow.\n\nRESOURCES\n\n## Learn more about Azure AI\n\nAzure for students\n\n### Student developer resources\n\nTake advantage of learning materials and programs that will help you jump-start your career.\n\n[Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/students/)\n\nResources\n\n### Azure resources\n\nAccess all the Azure resources you need, including tutorials, white papers, and code samples.\n\n[Explore resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources)\n\nAzure training\n\n### Azure learning hub\n\nBuild your AI skills with training customized to your role or specific technologies.\n\n[Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2251070&clcid=0x409)\n\nFAQ\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* LLM stands for large language model.\n* AI is a broad field that covers a wide range of applications beyond just language. It includes all technologies that aim to replicate human intelligence. As a specific type of AI model, LLMs are a subset of the broader AI landscape, one that focuses on processing and generating natural language text.\n* Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the overarching field focused on language processing, while large language models (LLMs) are a specific, advanced type of model within the field of NLP that uses deep learning techniques to handle language tasks.\n* Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) refers to a specific series of large language models (LLMs) developed by OpenAI. They are a type of LLM, with a specific focus on language generation.\n\n[Get the Azure mobile app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal/mobile-app)"), SearchResult(url='https://www.elastic.co/what-is/large-language-models', title='Understanding large language models', raw_content='# What are large language models (LLMs)?\n\n[Experiment with RAG using AI Playground](/demo-gallery/ai-playground)\n\n## Large language model definition\n\nAt its core, **a large language model (LLM) is a model trained using deep learning algorithms and capable of a broad range of** [**natural language processing (NLP)**](/what-is/natural-language-processing) **tasks, such as sentiment analysis, conversational question answering, text translation, classification, and generation**. An LLM is a type of [neural network (NN)](/what-is/neural-network) that specifically uses transformer architectures, which are models designed to detect dependencies between different parts of a sequence of data, regardless of their distance from each other. These neural networks are made up of layers of processing units, often compared to neurons in the brain. Large language models also have large numbers of parameters, akin to memories the model collects as it learns from training. Think of these parameters as the model\'s knowledge bank.\n\nThis processing capability allows LLMs to be trained for tasks like writing software code, language generation, and more, while specialized models handle tasks like understanding protein structures.1 Large language models must be pretrained and then fine-tuned to solve text classification, question answering, document summarization, text generation problems, and other tasks. Their problem-solving capabilities can be applied to fields like healthcare, finance, and entertainment, where LLMs serve a host of NLP applications, such as translation, chatbots, and AI assistants.\n\n**Watch this video and take a deeper dive into LLMs.**\n\n---\n\n## How do LLMs work?\n\nFundamentally, a large language model works by receiving an input, encoding it, and then decoding it to produce an output prediction, such as the next word, sentence, or a specific answer. Like all machine learning models, a large language model needs training and fine-tuning before it’s ready to output the expected and needed results. Here is how the process is refined:\n\n* **Training:** Large language models are pretrained using large textual datasets from sites like Wikipedia and GitHub. These datasets consist of trillions of words, and their quality is set to affect the language model\'s performance. At this stage, the large language model engages in unsupervised learning, meaning it processes the datasets fed to it without specific instructions. During this process, the algorithm learns to recognize the statistical relationships between words and their context. For example, it would learn to understand whether "right" means "correct," or the opposite of "left."\n* **Fine-tuning:** For a large language model to perform a specific task, such as translation, it must be fine-tuned to that particular activity. Fine-tuning adjusts the model\'s parameters to optimize its performance on specific tasks by training it on additional labeled data.\n* **Prompt-tuning** fulfills a similar function to fine-tuning, whereby it trains a model to carry out an operation through few-shot prompting, or zero-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting provides the model with examples to guide it in predicting outputs, such as:\n\n| Customer review | Customer sentiment |\n| --- | --- |\n| "This plant is so beautiful!" | **P**ositive |\n| "This plant is so hideous!" | **N**egative |\n\nIn this case, the model understands the meaning of "hideous" because an opposite example (beautiful) was provided.\n\nZero-shot prompting, however, doesn\'t use examples. Instead, it directly asks the model to perform a task, like:\n\n*"The sentiment in \'This plant is so hideous\' is ..."*\n\nBased on prior training, the model must predict the sentiment without any provided examples.\n\n---\n\n## Key components of large language models\n\nLarge language models are composed of multiple neural network layers. Embedding, attention, and feedforward layers work together to process the input text and generate output content.\n\n* **The embedding layer** creates vector [embeddings](/what-is/vector-embedding). from the input text, or mathematical representations of the words it is fed This part of the model captures the input\'s semantic and syntactic meaning so the model can contextually understand words and their relationships.\n* **The attention mechanism** enables the model to focus on all parts of the input text based on their relevance to the current task, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies.\n* **The feedforward layer** consists of multiple fully connected layers that apply nonlinear transformations to the data. These process the information after it has been encoded by the attention mechanism.\n\nThere are three main types of large language models:\n\n* **Generic or raw language models** predict the next word based on the language in the training data. These language models perform information retrieval tasks.\n* **Instruction-tuned language models** are trained to predict responses to the instructions given in the input. This allows them to perform [sentiment analysis](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/sentiment-analysis) or to generate text or code.\n* **Dialog-tuned language models** are trained to have a dialogue by predicting the next response. Think of chatbots or conversational AI.\n\n---\n\n## What is the difference between large language models and generative AI?\n\n[Generative AI](/what-is/generative-ai) is an umbrella term for artificial intelligence models that can create content. These models can generate text, code, images, video, and music. They can also specialize in different content types, such as text generation (e.g., ChatGPT) or image creation (e.g., DALL-E, MidJourney).\n\nLarge language models are a type of generative AI that are specifically trained on large textual datasets and are designed to produce textual content, such as in the case of ChatGPT.\n\nAll LLMs are generative AI, but not all generative AI models are LLMs. For example, DALL-E and MidJourney generate images, not text.\n\n---\n\n## What is a transformer model?\n\nA transformer model is the most common architecture of a large language model. It typically consists of both an encoder and a decoder, though some models, like GPT, use only the decoder. A transformer model processes data by tokenizing the input and then simultaneously conducting mathematical equations to discover relationships between tokens. This enables the computer to see the patterns a human would see were it given the same query.\n\nTransformer models work with self-attention mechanisms, which enable the models to learn more quickly than traditional models like long short-term memory models. Self-attention is what enables transformer models to capture relationships between words, even those far apart in a sentence, better than older models, primarily by allowing parallel processing of information.\n\nRelated: [Apply transformers to your search applications](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elastic-machine-learning-models)\n\n---\n\n## Large language models examples and use cases\n\nLarge language models can be used for several purposes:\n\n* [Information retrieval:](/what-is/information-retrieval) Think of Bing or Google. LLMs can be integrated into search engines to improve query responses. While traditional search engines mainly rely on indexing algorithms, LLMs enhance the ability to generate more conversational or context-aware answers based on a query.\n* [Sentiment analysis:](/what-is/sentiment-analysis) As applications of [natural language processing](/what-is/natural-language-processing), large language models enable companies to analyze the sentiment of textual data.\n* **Text generation:** Large language models like ChatGPT are behind generative AI systems and can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on given prompts. For example, you can prompt an LLM with "Write me a poem about palm trees in the style of Emily Dickinson."\n* **Code generation:** Like text generation, LLMs can generate code as an application of generative AI. LLMs can generate syntactically and logically correct code based on input prompts by learning from vast amounts of programming code in various languages.\n* **Chatbots and conversational AI:** Large language models power customer service chatbots and conversational AI. They help interpret customer queries, understand intent, and generate responses that simulate a human-like conversation.\n\n[Related: How to make a chatbot: Dos and don\'ts for developers](/blog/how-to-make-a-chatbot)\n\nIn addition to these use cases, large language models can complete sentences, answer questions, and summarize text.\n\nWith such a wide variety of applications, LLMs can be found in a multitude of fields:\n\n* **Tech:** Large language models are used in various applications, such as enhancing search engine query responses and assisting developers with writing code.\n* **Healthcare and science:** Large language models can analyze textual data related to proteins, molecules, DNA, and RNA, assisting in research, the development of vaccines, identifying potential cures for diseases, and improving preventative care medicines. LLMs are also used as medical chatbots for patient intakes or basic diagnoses, although they typically require human oversight.\n* **Customer service:** LLMs are used across industries for customer service purposes, such as chatbots or conversational AI.\n* **Marketing:** Marketing teams can use LLMs for sentiment analysis, content generation, and brainstorming campaign ideas, helping to generate text for pitches, advertisements, and other materials.\n* **Legal:** From searching through massive legal datasets to drafting legal documents, large language models can assist lawyers, paralegals, and legal staff.\n* **Banking:** LLMs can assist in analyzing financial transactions and customer communications to detect potential fraud, often as part of broader fraud detection systems.\n\n[Get started with generative AI in enterprise](/virtual-events/delivering-generative-ai). Watch this webinar and explore the challenges and opportunities of generative AI in your enterprise environment.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and challenges of LLMs\n\nLarge language models might give us the impression that they understand meaning and can respond accurately. However, they remain a tool that benefits from human supervision and face a variety of challenges.\n\n* **Hallucinations:** A hallucination is when an LLM produces an output that is false, or one that does not match the user\'s intent. For example, claiming that it is human, that it has emotions, or that it is in love with the user. Because large language models predict the next syntactically correct word or phrase, but they can\'t wholly interpret human meaning, the result can sometimes be what is referred to as a "hallucination."\n* **Security:** Large language models present significant security risks when not managed or monitored properly. They could inadvertently leak private information from training data or during interactions and be exploited for malicious purposes like phishing or generating spam. Users with malicious intent may also exploit LLMs to propagate biased ideologies, misinformation, or harmful content.\n* **Bias:** The data used to train language models will affect the outputs a given model produces. If the training data lacks diversity or is skewed toward a specific demographic, the model may reproduce these biases, resulting in outputs that reflect a biased — and likely narrow — perspective. Ensuring a diverse and representative training dataset is key to reducing bias in model outputs.\n* **Consent:** Large language models are trained on massive datasets, some of which may have been gathered without explicit consent or adherence to copyright agreements. This can result in violations of intellectual property rights, where content is reproduced without proper attribution or permission. Additionally, these models may scrape personal data, which raises privacy concerns.2 There have been instances where LLMs faced legal challenges, such as lawsuits by companies like Getty Images3 for copyright infringement.\n* **Scaling:** Scaling LLMs can be highly resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power. Maintaining such models involves continuous updates, optimizations, and monitoring, making it both a time- and cost-consuming process. The infrastructure needed to support these models is also substantial.\n* **Deployment:** Deploying large language models requires expertise in deep learning and transformer architectures, along with specialized hardware and distributed software systems.\n\n---\n\n## Benefits of LLMs\n\nWith a broad range of applications, large language models are exceptionally beneficial for problem-solving since they provide information in a clear, conversational style that is easy for users to understand.\n\n* **They have a wide range of applications:** They can be used for language translation, sentence completion, sentiment analysis, question answering, mathematical equations, and more.\n* **Always improving:** Large language model performance is continually improving as additional data and parameters are integrated. This improvement also depends on factors like model architecture and the quality of the training data added. In other words, the more a model learns, the better it gets. What\'s more, large language models can exhibit what is called "in-context learning," where the model can perform tasks based on examples provided in the prompt, without needing additional training or parameters. This enables the model to generalize and adapt to various tasks from just a few examples (few-shot learning) or even without prior examples (zero-shot learning). In this way, it is continually learning.\n* **They learn fast:** With in-context learning, LLMs can adapt to new tasks with minimal examples. While they don\'t need additional training or parameters, they can quickly respond to the prompt\'s context, making them efficient in scenarios where few examples are provided.\n\n---\n\n## Examples of popular large language models\n\nPopular large language models have taken the world by storm. Many have been adopted by people across industries. You\'ve no doubt heard of ChatGPT, a form of generative AI chatbot.\n\nOther popular LLM models include:\n\n* **PaLM:** Google\'s Pathways Language Model (PaLM) is a transformer language model capable of common-sense and arithmetic reasoning, joke explanation, code generation, and translation.\n* **BERT:** The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language model was also developed at Google. It is a transformer-based model that can understand natural language and answer questions.\n* **XLNet:** A permutation language model, XLNet trains on all possible permutations of input tokens, but it generates predictions in a standard left-to-right manner during inference.\n* **GPT:** Generative pretrained transformers are perhaps the best-known large language models. Developed by OpenAI, GPT is a popular foundational model whose numbered iterations are improvements on their predecessors (GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.). GPT models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Separately, other organizations have developed domain-specific models inspired by foundational LLMs, such as EinsteinGPT by Salesforce for CRM applications and BloombergGPT for financial data.\n\n[Related: Getting started guide to open source LLMs](/blog/open-source-llms-guide)\n\n---\n\n## Future advancements in large language models\n\nThe arrival of ChatGPT has brought large language models to the fore and activated speculation and heated debate on what the future might look like.\n\nAs large language models continue to grow and improve their command of natural language, there is much concern regarding what their advancement would do to the job market.\n\nIn the right hands, large language models can increase productivity and process efficiency, but this has posed ethical questions about their use in human society.\n\n---\n\n## Getting to know the Elasticsearch Relevance Engine\n\nTo address the current limitations of LLMs, the [Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE)](/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-relevance-engine) is a relevance engine built for artificial intelligence-powered search applications. With ESRE, developers are empowered to build their own [semantic search application](/what-is/semantic-search), utilize their own transformer models, and combine [NLP](/what-is/natural-language-processing) and [generative AI](/generative-ai) to enhance their customers\' search experience.\n\n[Supercharge your relevance with the Elasticsearch Relevance Engine](/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-relevance-engine)\n\n---\n\n## Explore more large language model resources\n\n* [LLM observability](/observability/llm-monitoring)\n* [Elastic generative AI tools and capabilities](/generative-ai)\n* [How to choose a vector database](/blog/how-to-choose-a-vector-database)\n* [How to make a chatbot: Dos and don’ts for developers](/blog/how-to-make-a-chatbot)\n* [Choosing an LLM: The getting started guide to open source LLMs](/blog/open-source-llms-guide)\n* [Language models in Elasticsearch](/blog/language-models-in-elasticsearch)\n* [2025 technical trends: Embracing the era of choice to bring GenAI into production](/virtual-events/2025-technical-search-trends)\n* [Overview of natural language processing (NLP) in the Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/machine-learning/nlp/ml-nlp-overview)\n* [Compatible third-party models with the Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/machine-learning/nlp/ml-nlp-model-ref)\n* [Guide to trained models in the Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/machine-learning/data-frame-analytics/ml-trained-models)\n* [The LLM Safety Assessment](/security/llm-safety-report)\n\n---\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1.

This evolution has transformed how machines understand and generate human language, revolutionizing countless applications.\n\n## What is LLMs？\n\nA Large Language Model (LLM) is like a super-powered “reader” and “writer.” First, it “reads” almost all the text it can find on the internet—books, websites, conversations—then learns two main tricks:\n\n• Word-by-word guessing: predicting the next most likely word.\n\n• Question answering: putting what it learned into new sentences when you give it a prompt.\n\nSo you can just chat with it like a friend, and it will write stories, translate, summarize, code, or even do simple reasoning. In short， an LLM is an AI trained on oceans of text and really good at talking like a human.\n\n## The Dawn of AI (1950s – 2000s)\n\nThe story begins in 1950 with the\xa0**Dartmouth Conference**, where the term “artificial intelligence” was coined. Though limited by data scarcity and computational power, this event planted the seed for future innovations. Two major schools of thought emerged: symbolic reasoning, which focused on rule-based systems, and connectionism, which drew inspiration from the human brain’s neural networks.\n\nIn the 1980s, IBM’s expert systems marked early practical applications of machine learning, such as spam detection. A significant milestone came when IBM’s Deep Blue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov, showcasing AI’s potential in complex decision-making.\n\n## The Rise of Deep Learning (2010s)\n\nThree key factors drove this revolution. First, ImageNet provided massive labeled image datasets. Second, GPUs enabled efficient parallel computing. Third, frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch simplified model development.\n\nChina’s “AI Four Dragons” emerged during this period. SenseTime, Megvii, CloudWalk, and Yitu led global AI innovation. Their success highlighted worldwide participation in AI progress.\n\nA major breakthrough came in 2014. The paper\xa0*“Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate”*\xa0introduced attention mechanisms. This allowed models to focus on relevant input parts. It solved RNNs’ struggles with long-range dependencies.\n\nThis innovation paved the way for Transformers. Later models like GPT and BERT built upon this foundation. The 2010s set the stage for modern AI advancements.\n\n## Transformer Architecture and Pre-training Era (2017 – 2020)\n\nThe year 2017 marked a turning point with the publication of “Attention Is All You Need,” introducing the\xa0**Transformer architecture**. This revolutionary design, based entirely on self-attention mechanisms, eliminated reliance on RNNs, enabling parallel processing and better capture of contextual relationships.\n\nIn 2018, OpenAI’s\xa0**GPT-1**\xa0pioneered the “pre-training and fine-tuning” paradigm. Using 110 million parameters trained on 7,000 books, it demonstrated how large-scale unlabeled data could create versatile language models adaptable to specific tasks with minimal fine-tuning.\n\nGoogle’s\xa0**BERT**\xa0(2018) further advanced language understanding through bidirectional training, while GPT-2 (2019) scaled up to 1.5 billion parameters, generating coherent text across diverse topics.\n\n## The Big Model Revolution (2020 – 2022)\n\n2020 saw the arrival of\xa0**GPT-3**\xa0with a staggering 175 billion parameters, ushering in the era of true large language models. Its breakthrough capability was “in-context learning,” allowing task execution through prompt engineering without parameter adjustments. This shifted the paradigm from task-specific fine-tuning to flexible prompt-based interaction.\n\nGoogle’s\xa0**T5**\xa0(2021) introduced a unified “text-to-text” framework, treating all NLP tasks as text generation. 2022 brought significant advancements with\xa0**GPT-3.5**\xa0incorporating instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), greatly improving response quality and safety. Google’s\xa0**PaLM**\xa0(540 billion parameters) demonstrated exceptional performance across NLP tasks, while LaMDA focused on natural conversational abilities.\n\n## Multimodal Expansion and Engineering Excellence (2023 – 2025)\n\n2023 witnessed\xa0**GPT-4**\xa0breaking ground with multimodal capabilities, processing text and images while introducing a plugin ecosystem. Meta’s open-source\xa0**LLaMA**\xa0models (7-65 billion parameters) promoted research accessibility, while Anthropic’s\xa0**Claude 2**\xa0emphasized safety and long-text processing.\n\nAfter 2024, the frontier shifted from new theories to meticulous craftsmanship—polishing jade within existing frames.\n\nClaude 3 set new standards for multimodal fusion: upload a photo, a chart, or a napkin sketch and the model parses it precisely. Its 1-million-token context window—twenty copies of *Dream of the Red Chamber*—and “Artifacts” feature let users edit documents or code in a side panel and preview results live, fusing creation and interaction.\n\nGemini 2.0 wields a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Like a smart triage desk, it activates only the neural “expert modules” needed for the task—math circuits for equations, language circuits for prose—yielding several-fold speed-ups. Designed natively multimodal, it treats text, images, and video as one continuum, avoiding the patchwork feel of later bolt-ons.\n\nChatGPT-4o internalizes chain-of-thought. It “thinks” step-by-step, as a human would: to compute 38 × 27, it silently derives 30 × 27 = 810, 8 × 27 = 216, and sums to 1026. The longer it “ponders,” the higher the accuracy.\n\nDeepSeek R1 pushes autonomy further. Trained solely on verifiable data—math steps and code—it uses a four-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning → reinforcement learning → secondary fine-tuning → hybrid reward learning. The result rivals closed-source models while remaining fully open, letting researchers inspect every “thought.” This frees AI training from costly human labeling and ushers in self-evolution.\n\n## Future Trends\n\nCurrent developments point toward several trends: multimodal models integrating text, image, audio, and video; more efficient training methods reducing computational costs; and increased focus on AI alignment and safety to ensure models behave ethically. As large language models continue to evolve, they promise to become even more integral to daily life, blending seamlessly with human capabilities across industries.\n\nFrom the musings of the Dartmouth Conference to today’s conversational agents, the 75-year odyssey of large models is ultimately humanity’s ceaseless interrogation of intelligence itself. These breakthroughs are not merely technical; they are redefining the relationships among humans, machines, data, and the world. Perhaps one day, when AI can feel emotions and create art as we do, we will look back and realize that the road paved with code and data has led not only to smarter machines but to a deeper understanding of ourselves.\n\n## Sign up for more.')]), SearchResults(query=Query(query='applications of large language models in various fields'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.coursera.org/articles/large-language-model-applications', title='Large Language Model Applications: Transforming the Way We ...', raw_content='* [For Individuals](https://www.coursera.org/)\n* [For Businesses](https://www.coursera.org/business?utm_content=corp-to-home-for-enterprise&utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=coursera&utm_source=header&utm_term=b-out)\n* [For Universities](https://www.coursera.org/campus?utm_content=corp-to-landing-for-campus&utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=coursera&utm_source=header&utm_term=b-out)\n* [For Governments](https://www.coursera.org/government?utm_content=corp-to-landing-for-government&utm_campaign=website&utm_medium=coursera&utm_source=header&utm_term=b-out)\n\n* [Log In](/articles/large-language-model-applications?authMode=login)\n* [Join for Free](/articles/large-language-model-applications?authMode=signup)\n\n# Large Language Model Applications: Transforming the Way We Interact with Technology\n\nWritten by Coursera Staff • Updated on\n\nLarge language model applications (LLMs) are foundational to the development of today’s artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Discover how LLMs have revolutionized text generation, machine learning, and AI interaction in various fields.\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n[Large language models (LLMs)](https://www.coursera.org/articles/large-language-models) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) and the way people interact with much of today’s digital ecosystem. Here are some important things to know:\n\n* LLMs have many applications, including text generation, content summarization, translation, and powering chatbots.\n\n* Selecting the right LLM requires balancing its specific capabilities, cost, and the trade-off between model size and performance.\n\n* Effective LLM use requires strong AI governance to mitigate risks like data bias, privacy vulnerabilities, and a lack of transparency.\n\nExplore some common uses of LLMs and how to select the best one for your use case. Then, consider enrolling in the [AI Foundations for Everyone Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-foundations-for-everyone) from IBM, designed for those with little or no background in AI, whether you have a technology background or not.\n\n## Common applications of large language models\n\nLLMs have a variety of [use cases](https://www.coursera.org/articles/llm-use-cases). Common applications of large language models include:\n\n### Text generation\n\nLLMs allow you to generate a variety of different types of text, such as:\n\n* Blogs\n* Articles\n* Scripts\n* Summaries\n* Social media posts\n\nIf you don’t want to use an LLM to create an entire text, you can interact with it to get ideas you can then use to create the text yourself. As sophisticated as LLMs are, their output quality depends not only on the effectiveness of their training but also on the precision of the prompts you provide.\n\nAn LLM’s sophisticated language skills allow it to craft nuanced text in various voices and tones, with [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-rag-in-ai) bolstering its capabilities. RAG is an AI training technique that ties an AI model to external sources of expert knowledge in order to supplement its prior training data. This helps keep an LLM up to date on changes in data, making its output more likely to be factually reliable. RAG also allows you to examine an LLM’s data sources to double-check them for accuracy. This helps alleviate the challenge of LLM and generative AI transparency.\n\n### Chatbots and virtual assistants\n\nLLMs now power different types of chatbots and virtual assistants. You can use these to enhance customer support and speed up time to resolution.\n\nVirtual assistants allow you to perform basic customer service functions for yourself, such as:\n\n* Request information about a product or service\n* Request refunds\n* Lodge complaints\n\nAll of the above are basic tasks that an AI platform can automate, allowing human customer service workers to handle more complex interactions and improve overall customer experience and efficiency. Furthermore, LLM-derived chatbots can provide translations that are both faster and more accurate than traditional human customer service agents. LLMs also boost productivity and efficiency by operating constantly, allowing your business to provide consistent customer support without relying solely on human agents.\n\nLLM-derived chatbots and virtual assistants utilize an omnichannel approach. That is, you can program them for use on a variety of platforms such as websites, kiosks, mobile apps, and social media. Users can, therefore, prompt them anywhere.\n\n### Content summarization\n\nYou may eventually need to parse lengthy texts to locate pertinent information. Given this time-consuming task, you may overlook vital points. LLMs can perform this type of content summarization much more quickly and accurately.\n\nLLMs can analyze and summarize a variety of texts, such as:\n\n* Articles\n* Reports\n* Research papers\n* Various corporate documents\n* Customer history and information\n\nFast and accurate text summarization allows you to better understand the more meaningful content in a large document. Workers in the finance, media, and government sectors find LLM text summarization helpful.\n\nDue to their linguistic sophistication, LLMs are uniquely suited to document summarization, which can take two forms:\n\n* **Extractive summarization** involves an LLM deciding what’s important in a text and extracting key phrases. This allows for greater summarization accuracy. You can double-check your LLM’s work this way, too, since its output comes plainly and traceably from the document in question.\n\n* **Abstractive summarization** is essentially paraphrasing. Due to their proficiency in understanding text and language, LLMs can efficiently parse large documents, identify key points important to humans, and summarize this information in clear language, mitigating possible jargon.\n\n### Translation services\n\nLLMs allow AI to understand and produce content in sophisticated ways. They can understand the cultural context to some extent, reply to queries coherently, and translate high-quality languages.\n\nGiven that an LLM\'s translation accuracy depends on the quality and quantity of its training data, robust data sets are essential for accessing the benefits of fast and accurate translations in a globalized world.\n\nLLMs possess certain advantages over [previous generations](https://www.coursera.org/articles/history-of-ai) of machine learning-based translation technology. They can:\n\n* Generate increasingly human-like text\n* Operate on an entire document all at once, rather than segment by segment\n* Perform language-related tasks in other languages, as well as translate between them\n\n### Sentiment analysis\n\nThis is important in the marketing realm in particular. Simply put, sentiment analysis is how you determine whether a customer’s review is positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nLLMs allow you to automate this process, scanning a variety of text types for sentiment analysis, such as:\n\n* Reviews\n* Social media posts\n* Emails\n* Customer support interaction transcripts\n\nBy allowing AI to perform sentiment analysis, you’re mitigating potential personal bias and speeding up the process. Additionally, by analyzing sentiment analysis results in real-time, LLMs let you keep up with quick shifts in public opinion. This allows you to refine and deliver improved products with unprecedented speed.\n\n## Choosing the right model\n\nMany LLM models exist, including:\n\n* ChatGPT\n* Claude 2\n* Llama 2\n\nWhen choosing which LLM is right for you, you’ll want to consider your specific business needs. First of all, some programmers train LLM models on text alone—they don’t include audio or visual inputs in the training process. If you want to utilize an LLM trained on audiovisual data, you’ll want to select one with that capability. This type of multimodal LLM is particularly useful for developing conversational AI, the technology behind devices such as Siri and Alexa.\n\nAn additional factor is cost. Some LLMs are expensive, while others are free and open-source. Some models operate on a subscription basis, while others use a "token" pricing structure. In this model, you are charged once you reach a certain output generation threshold.\n\nChoosing an LLM involves balancing accuracy from vast training data with usability; larger models may lead to slower response times.\n\nDifferent LLM models, and their attendant AI platforms, have different capabilities. GitHub CoPilot, for example, writes code. If you don’t need an LLM that writes code, it may not be the right model for you.\n\nDevelopers can tailor some LLMs to meet specific use case requirements, and fine-tuning their training data helps to improve accuracy. This is domain specificity, and it comes with benefits such as increases in:\n\n* Precision\n* Reliability\n* Safety\n* Efficiency\n* User experience\n\n## Ethical considerations\n\nLLMs and AI come with [ethical considerations](https://www.coursera.org/articles/generative-ai-ethics). Developing rules around AI governance and responsible AI policy is important for any business using AI.\n\nMicrosoft outlines a six-point responsible AI policy [[1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai)] that involves:\n\n1. Fairness\n2. Reliability and safety\n3. Privacy and security\n4. Inclusiveness\n5. Transparency\n6. Accountability\n\nIssues of bias are inherent to LLMs; their outputs reflect the biases present in their training data unless addressed during data selection. These biases, such as racism, sexism, and xenophobia, can lead to harmful outputs that some may perceive as truth instead of an error, with inaccuracies becoming more common in large training data sets.\n\nAnother issue LLM users face is data privacy. LLMs can not only incorporate biased or factually inaccurate content but also inadvertently capture highly sensitive customer information, which can be vulnerable to malicious use by hackers.\n\nLLM transparency can address these issues to a certain extent. However, the technology\'s complexity makes clear explanations difficult, especially as reliance on LLMs grows in high-stakes industries like finance and medicine.\n\nBeing transparent about your LLM’s flaws fosters public trust. You might choose to share information such as:\n\n* Your AI model’s training protocol\n* Its approach to logic and reasoning, as far as you understand it\n* Its training inputs and where they come from\n* Your techniques for model evaluation\n* How you handle bias and other issues of fairness\n\n## Learn more about LLMs and AI with Coursera\n\nInterested in learning more about AI?

From business and education to research and creativity, this form of artificial intelligence (AI) automates complex tasks, streamlines processes, and enhances user and organizational experiences. The adaptability of LLM applications across multiple contexts makes them strategic, versatile tools for all kinds of industries.\n\nIn this post, we explore LLM applications across different industrial sectors, their advantages and limitations, and their growing role in logistics and warehouse management.\n\n## What are LLMs and how are they used in industry?\n\nLLM stands for **large language model**, which is an AI system trained on vast amounts of text using machine learning techniques, specifically deep neural networks. The goal of LLM applications is to perform a wide range of tasks, from recognizing patterns and understanding language to producing coherent responses.\n\nThese models represent a major leap forward in AI because they process language much like humans do: answering questions, translating, summarizing information, writing long texts, or even generating code. Today, users and companies alike can access LLM applications through tools such as **ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini**. Their versatility explains why organizations in many sectors are eager to integrate them into daily operations.\n\nIn **business and industry**, applications of LLMs support everything from **customer service** (through round-the-clock automated assistance) to content creation. They also enhance **corporate training** by simulating real-life scenarios to improve communication and problem-solving skills. In e-commerce, they personalize the customer experience with tailored recommendations. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, they enable [predictive maintenance](/blog/predictive-maintenance) and process optimization by interpreting data from sensors and equipment.\n\n## Benefits of using LLMs in industry\n\nLLM applications offer clear advantages for organizations looking to automate language-related tasks such as content generation, document analysis, and customer communications.\n\nKey benefits include:\n\n* **Decision-making support**. LLMs help analyze massive datasets and summarize them into actionable insights, allowing companies to identify trends, risks, and opportunities. While they don’t replace human judgment, they strengthen strategic decisions with richer, more accessible data.\n* **Process optimization**. When combined with sensor data, technical reports, or operational records, LLMs interpret information, uncovering patterns and anomalies. This supports early issue detection and process planning, leading to faster, more cost-efficient operations.\n* **Higher productivity**. By generating text and code, LLM applications free professionals from repetitive tasks so they can focus on solving complex challenges and driving innovation.\n* **Scalability and efficiency**. LLMs process large volumes of information and lengthy documents simultaneously, helping organizations handle workload peaks and grow sustainably.\n\nBeyond process optimization and cost reduction, LLM applications are redefining how companies innovate. By automating repetitive tasks, they enable professionals to concentrate on higher-value, creative work.\n\n## Limitations of LLM applications\n\nWhile industrial applications of large language models unlock enormous potential across sectors, understanding their limits is essential for using them responsibly:\n\n* **Hallucinations**. LLM applications may “see” patterns or connections that don’t exist, generating inaccurate or fabricated information that may sound convincing but lacks factual basis.\n* **Bias**. Because they learn from real-world data, LLMs can inherit existing biases, leading to outputs that reinforce stereotypes or exclude certain social groups.\n* **Privacy**. There’s a risk that applications of large language models might reproduce fragments of confidential data used during training, unintentionally revealing sensitive information.\n* **Limited reasoning**. LLMs are not autonomous thinkers. They generate text based on patterns, requiring human oversight to validate outputs and ensure they align with organizational goals.\n\nThese challenges affect logistics and supply chain management, in particular. A [study from the University of Cambridge](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ge-Zheng-7/publication/386414179_LLMs_in_Supply_Chain_Management_Opportunities_and_Case_Study/links/6750464aa7fbc259f1ac7eae/LLMs-in-Supply-Chain-Management-Opportunities-and-Case-Study.pdf) found that general-purpose models like [ChatGPT](/blog/chatgpt-supply-chain) aren’t always effective in business contexts. Since they lack company-specific knowledge, their answers can be incomplete or irrelevant. The researchers suggest developing custom models trained on internal data for more accurate results. However, this requires significant data volumes and computing power. Despite the challenges, ongoing research and specialized tools show that industrial LLM integration is becoming increasingly feasible.\n\n## Common applications of LLMs\n\nLarge language models have countless practical uses that are already changing how people and organizations work, learn, and communicate. To harness their full potential, it’s critical to understand [how to use artificial intelligence](/blog/how-to-use-artificial-intelligence):\n\n* **Data analysis and insights**. LLM applications can adapt to different types of language and formats. They extract relevant information from unstructured data — even from loosely formatted documents — recognize key entities, and take into account the context in which they appear.\n* **Automated internal communication**. LLM applications streamline queries in HR (leave policies and payroll) and IT (troubleshooting and account setup). They also help standardize templates and newsletters, maintaining a consistent tone across internal communications.\n* **Programming assistance**. LLMs support software developers by suggesting code snippets, detecting errors, and proposing solutions. They adapt to different programming languages and offer contextualized recommendations, speeding up development.\n* **Virtual assistance**. These systems power conversational assistants that answer customer questions, perform internal tasks, and deliver clear, natural-language information. Their integration into self-service solutions enhances the customer experience.\n* **Technical documentation and content generation**. Through user prompts, LLM applications can draft texts in multiple formats and styles, improving contextual relevance and reducing repetitive work.\n* **Translation and localization**. LLMs translate between languages and analyze large text datasets — such as customer feedback and internal documentation — fostering faster, more efficient global communication.\n\n## LLM examples by industry\n\nLLMs are making waves in diverse sectors, adapting to each one’s unique challenges and workflows. These examples of LLMs in different industries show how AI is transforming how we work, learn, produce, and consume.\n\n* **Automotive**. A study by the [University of Stuttgart’s Institute of Automotive Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827125004639), in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz AG, shows how LLM applications can play a crucial role in software development for vehicle manufacturing. They help anticipate the impact of updates and shorter release cycles on assembly lines, maintaining product quality and improving coordination between software and production teams. While manual validation and sophisticated evaluation methods are still necessary, this approach promises greater process stability and tighter integration between digital innovation and manufacturing.\n* **Ecommerce**. A paper by [Brandeis University’s Michtom School of Computer Science and eBay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12779) indicates that LLMs are already employed for tasks such as generating product descriptions, summarizing reviews, expanding search queries, and managing buyer-seller inquiries. They also detect consumer trends, fine-tune merchandise management, and offer personalized recommendations, improving both the customer experience and operational efficiency.\n* **Manufacturing**. Research by [MIT, in collaboration with Harvard and the University of Washington](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14377), highlights how LLM applications can support the entire product design and manufacturing process. These tools can transform ideas expressed in natural language into technical specifications, generate design variations, translate them into machine instructions, and even estimate product performance. The study revealed that LLM applications can accelerate the creation of prototypes and shorten the gap between the initial idea and the physical product. Nevertheless, the MIT experts caution that there are still limitations — as in the case of geometrically complex designs — so LLMs should be combined with human expertise and specialized tools.\n* **Chemicals**. [Carnegie Mellon University](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20921) researchers demonstrated how LLM technology can optimize chemical processes. Traditionally, this required complex calculations as well as full knowledge of operating conditions, which isn’t always possible. The new approach uses multiple LLM-based agents that collaborate to propose operating limits and automatically identify optimal parameters. This opens the door to applying these techniques in existing chemical plants and new processes, reducing costs and accelerating innovation.\n\n## LLM applications in logistics\n\nLogistics is a natural fit for LLMs: wherever data and decisions converge, these models can add value. Implementing [AI in warehouse management](/blog/ai-in-warehouse-management) helps optimize workflows, prevent incidents, and support real-time decision-making.\n\nA study from [MIT’s Sloan School of Management](https://executive.mit.edu/blog/the-future-of-supply-chain-planning-faster-smarter-decisions-with-llms.html) points out that digital technologies are changing how supply chain decisions are made. Still, logistics professionals often need expert support to interpret system recommendations or run what-if analyses. With LLMs, that process can happen in seconds instead of hours or days, boosting operational efficiency.\n\nCompanies can implement LLM technology to enhance logistics processes through:\n\n* **Data analysis**. LLM applications allow natural-language queries such as “What happens if demand changes?” or “Which contracts should I review?” The system pulls from internal data and returns clear answers without disclosing sensitive information.\n* **Scenario simulation**. Supply chain planning often calls for evaluating hypothetical situations — demand surges, production interruptions, or price shifts. LLMs convert these queries into calculations and generate easy-to-understand explanations that support decision-making.\n* **Real-time management**. When an issue arises — for example, deciding where to allocate inventory — users simply describe the situation in plain language. The LLM tool adjusts the calculations and proposes alternative plans in a format accessible to non-technical teams.\n\nA practical example of an LLM use case in logistics is Interlake Mecalux’s [Easy\xa0AI](/software/updates/generative-ai), integrated into the [Easy\xa0WMS warehouse management system](/software/wms-warehouse-management-system). Through its chat interface, users can ask complex questions in seven languages. They can query warehouse data in natural language and receive responses in various formats (figures, tables, or charts), create custom KPI dashboards, generate downloadable reports, design on-demand data views, and perform specific actions such as releasing rush orders and unlocking aisles. This integration helps companies speed up their facility operations and processes and access information more efficiently.\n\n## LLM applications in industry: Building smarter operations\n\nThe rapid growth in LLM usage reflects how organizations are embracing these tools to change how they access, interpret, and utilize information. Their ability to turn data into practical knowledge is enabling **faster, more accurate operations**. But successful adoption requires awareness of LLM limitations — such as potential bias or factual errors — and careful human oversight.\n\nIn logistics, LLM applications have **tremendous potential** in everything from inventory optimization to real-time reporting that supports better decisions. Solutions like Interlake Mecalux’s Easy\xa0AI show that the key lies in purpose-built tools designed for warehouse needs. The future points toward an industrial landscape where AI complements — rather than replaces — human teams, driving productivity and resilience across the board.\n\n## LLM applications in 5 questions\n\n### What are LLMs?\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on massive volumes of text. They recognize patterns, understand language, and generate coherent responses, allowing them to summarize information, translate languages, write texts, and analyze data.\n\n### What are LLMs used for ?\n\nThe main applications of LLMs include customer service support via chatbots, enhanced training through simulations, and programming assistance with code generation, review, and fine-tuning. They also help create content, technical reports, and translations, refining processes in various industrial sectors.\n\n### What are the pros and cons of using LLMs in industry?\n\nLLM applications offer clear benefits in industry. They increase productivity (by automating repetitive tasks), improve customer service (by providing immediate and personalized responses), and support decision-making (by rapidly analyzing large datasets). They can also facilitate internal training and the generation of technical documentation.\n\n### Which industrial sectors use LLM models?\n\nLanguage models have a cross-sector reach. They can be applied in virtually any industrial field to optimize internal processes, customer interaction, and decision-making. Clear examples of this versatility can be seen in the automotive, ecommerce, manufacturing, and chemical industries, where LLM applications have become a strategic tool for achieving efficiency and agility.\n\n### How are LLMs applied in logistics?\n\nIn logistics, LLM applications allow users to query vital information such as inventory, orders, or contracts in natural language. They also help manage incidents and inventory allocations in real time, providing easily understandable responses. This improves communication, reduces errors, and supports strategic decision-making. Solutions like Interlake Mecalux’s Easy\xa0AI integrate these capabilities directly into warehouse management, streamlining intralogistics operations.\n\n### Recent entries\n\n* [Supply chain planning: How to optimize this critical process](/blog/supply-chain-planning "Supply chain planning: How to optimize this critical process")\n* [How to reduce returns in ecommerce](/blog/how-to-reduce-returns-in-ecommerce "How to reduce returns in ecommerce")\n* [How to use AI for business: Implementation and benefits](/blog/how-to-use-ai-for-business "How to use AI for business: Implementation and benefits")\n* [Greenfield vs. brownfield logistics projects](/blog/greenfield-vs-brownfield "Greenfield vs. brownfield logistics projects")\n* [Intelligent automation: Definition and main applications in business](/blog/intelligent-automation "Intelligent automation: Definition and main applications in business")\n\n* [Warehouse Automation](/blog/warehouse-automation "Warehouse Automation")\n* [Logistics Software](/blog/logistics-software "Logistics Software")\n* [Warehouse Management Solutions](/blog/warehouse-management "Warehouse Management Solutions")\n  + [Warehouse Organization & Design](/blog/warehouse-management/organization-design "Warehouse Organization & Design")\n  + [Order Fulfillment](/blog/warehouse-management/order-fulfillment "Order Fulfillment")\n  + [Warehouse Safety & Staff Management](/blog/warehouse-management/safety-staff-management "Warehouse Safety & Staff Management")\n  + [Industrial Storage Systems](/blog/warehouse-management/industrial-storage-systems "Industrial Storage Systems")')])]}}

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ["## Benchmarking Methods for Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nThe evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical aspect of artificial intelligence research, especially given the rapid development and deployment of models such as GPT-4 and Claude. Benchmarking methods are employed to assess the performance, reliability, and ethical implications of these systems. By systematically comparing models using both qualitative and quantitative metrics, researchers can gain valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations, guiding future advancements in the field.\n\n### Core Concepts and Definitions\n\n**Benchmarking LLMs** involves a structured approach that encompasses defining objectives, selecting appropriate metrics, and preparing relevant datasets for evaluation. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of a model's performance across various tasks. \n\n**Qualitative Metrics** are subjective evaluations that focus on aspects such as coherence, relevance, and user satisfaction. These metrics often rely on human judgment and expert reviews to assess the quality of model outputs.\n\n**Quantitative Metrics**, in contrast, provide objective statistical measures that facilitate straightforward comparisons between models. They typically include performance indicators such as accuracy, F1 scores, and other task-specific benchmarks.\n\n### Qualitative and Quantitative Benchmarking Approaches\n\nThe evaluation of LLMs can be categorized into qualitative and quantitative approaches, each offering unique insights into model performance.\n\n#### Qualitative Metrics\n\nQualitative assessments are essential for understanding nuanced model behaviors that numerical metrics may overlook. Common qualitative methods include:\n\n- **Human Evaluations**: Raters assess outputs based on criteria such as fluency, coherence, and informativeness. For instance, human judges might review text generated by an LLM for its ability to maintain context and engage the reader effectively.\n\n- **User Studies**: These studies gather feedback from end-users regarding their experiences and satisfaction with LLM outputs. Insights from user studies can illuminate the model's usability in real-world applications, revealing strengths and weaknesses that might not be apparent through quantitative measures alone.\n\n#### Quantitative Metrics\n\nQuantitative metrics provide objective assessments of model performance, allowing for scalable evaluations across large datasets. Key quantitative measures include:\n\n- **Perplexity**: This metric evaluates how well a probability distribution predicts a sample, with lower perplexity indicating better performance in language modeling tasks.\n\n- **BLEU Score**: Primarily utilized in machine translation, the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score measures the overlap between generated text and reference translations. A higher BLEU score suggests that the output closely resembles human translations.\n\n- **ROUGE Score**: Often used in summarization tasks, ROUGE measures the overlap of n-grams between generated summaries and reference texts, providing insight into the model's ability to capture essential information.\n\n- **F1 Score**: This metric combines precision and recall, offering a balanced measure of a model's accuracy, particularly in classification tasks where class distributions may be imbalanced.\n\n### Importance of a Hybrid Approach\n\nRecent studies emphasize the benefits of combining qualitative and quantitative metrics in benchmarking LLMs. A hybrid approach enhances the evaluation process by capturing a broader range of model behaviors. For example, qualitative metrics can identify biases that automated evaluations might miss, while quantitative metrics facilitate direct comparisons across different models and datasets. This multifaceted evaluation is particularly crucial in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where a comprehensive understanding of model performance can lead to significant improvements in accuracy and reliability.\n\n### Overview of Standard Datasets Used for Benchmarking\n\nThe benchmarking of LLMs is heavily reliant on standard datasets, which provide the foundation for reliable performance evaluation. A well-structured dataset is essential for ensuring that assessments are valid and replicable. Notable datasets commonly used in benchmarking include:\n\n- **GLUE/SuperGLUE**: The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, along with its successor SuperGLUE, consists of diverse tasks designed to evaluate general language understanding capabilities. These tasks include sentiment analysis, question answering, and textual entailment, offering a comprehensive assessment of a model's performance across various challenges.\n\n- **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: This dataset is tailored for question-answering tasks, comprising questions based on Wikipedia articles. It serves as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs' abilities to comprehend and extract relevant information from text.\n\n- **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: Evaluating models on their capacity to perform natural language inference across different genres, MNLI is crucial for testing a model's understanding of relationships between texts.\n\n- **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: Although primarily an image dataset, COCO is often used in multimodal benchmarks, assessing LLMs on their ability to generate textual descriptions of images and integrating visual and linguistic knowledge.\n\nThese datasets offer standardized frameworks for evaluation, promoting the replicability of results and allowing for meaningful comparisons across different models. Researchers can utilize these established benchmarks to ensure rigorous methodologies underpin their assessments.\n\n### Robustness and Fairness Testing\n\nAs LLMs are integrated into critical applications, robustness and fairness testing become paramount. LLMs should be evaluated against adversarial inputs to identify vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to prompt injections or other manipulative strategies. Tools and frameworks are being developed to enhance model resilience and ensure that biases are adequately addressed during evaluations. Fairness assessments are integral to the benchmarking process, ensuring equitable treatment of all demographic groups and compliance with ethical standards.\n\n### Emerging Trends and Future Directions\n\nThe rapid advancement of LLM capabilities necessitates continuous refinement of benchmarking methods. Traditional benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE have raised concerns about saturation, prompting researchers to explore new evaluation paradigms that assess deeper reasoning capabilities and commonsense understanding. Benchmarks such as **TruthfulQA** and **HellaSwag** reflect this shift, emphasizing the importance of factual correctness and reasoning in LLM evaluations.\n\nAdditionally, frameworks like Stanford HELM and the Language Model Evaluation Harness provide comprehensive strategies for assessing model performance across various tasks and contexts. The emergence of these frameworks highlights the need for robust evaluation methodologies that adapt to the evolving landscape of LLM development, ensuring that models are not only performant but also ethical and safe for deployment. \n\nThe integration of qualitative and quantitative metrics within these frameworks underscores the importance of a multifaceted approach to benchmarking, fostering a deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and guiding future research in the field."], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='benchmarking methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) qualitative and quantitative metrics'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://aclanthology.org/2025.tacl-1.11/', title='Benchmarking Uncertainty Quantification Methods for Large ...', raw_content='## [Benchmarking Uncertainty Quantification Methods for Large Language Models with LM-Polygraph](https://aclanthology.org/2025.tacl-1.11.pdf)\n\n[Roman Vashurin](/people/roman-vashurin/), [Ekaterina Fadeeva](/people/ekaterina-fadeeva/), [Artem Vazhentsev](/people/artem-vazhentsev/), [Lyudmila Rvanova](/people/lyudmila-rvanova/), [Daniil Vasilev](/people/daniil-vasilev/), [Akim Tsvigun](/people/akim-tsvigun/), [Sergey Petrakov](/people/sergey-petrakov/), [Rui Xing](/people/rui-xing/), [Abdelrahman Sadallah](/people/abdelrahman-sadallah/), [Kirill Grishchenkov](/people/kirill-grishchenkov/), [Alexander Panchenko](/people/alexander-panchenko/), [Timothy Baldwin](/people/timothy-baldwin/), [Preslav Nakov](/people/preslav-nakov/), [Maxim Panov](/people/maxim-panov/), [Artem Shelmanov](/people/artem-shelmanov/)\n\n##### Correct Metadata for\n\n##### Abstract\n\nThe rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has stimulated researchers to seek effective and efficient approaches to deal with LLM hallucinations and low-quality outputs.

Modern LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude exhibit broad capabilities, making it difficult to measure their true performance and limitations with any single metric or dataset. Evaluation is critical for tracking progress and ensuring models are reliable, factual, and safe in real-world use, but it is inherently complex because LLMs must be assessed across many dimensions. Recent work emphasizes holistic evaluation: covering not just accuracy, but also reasoning, truthfulness, safety, bias, robustness, efficiency, and more. In fact, “language models… capabilities, limitations, and risks are not well understood”, prompting efforts like the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to taxonomize use cases and metrics. As models become more capable, new evaluation benchmarks continually emerge to keep up with frontier behaviors - GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s upcoming Gemini, Meta’s LLaMA and newer open models like Mistral are pushing performance into human-expert range, often saturating older benchmarks.\n\nWhy is evaluation so challenging? One reason is that LLMs are now general-purpose systems deployed in diverse tasks, from question-answering to coding to conversation. A model might excel at standardized exams but falter in open-ended dialogue. For example, GPT-4 achieved human-level scores on many professional and academic exams (it ranks in the top 10% on a simulated bar exam, whereas GPT-3.5 was in the bottom 10% ). Yet simply scoring well on knowledge tests doesn’t guarantee a model is useful or aligned in interactive settings. Researchers have observed that fine-tuned conversational models (trained via human feedback) are strongly preferred by users, but do not always score higher on traditional benchmarks like MMLU or HELM. This mismatch highlights that conventional benchmarks capture only part of an LLM’s capability. In response, the evaluation landscape has expanded into a spectrum of benchmark categories, each probing a different facet of an LLM’s performance. Below, we provide a deep technical analysis of these categories and the latest benchmarks in each, before discussing integrated evaluation suites and open problems in benchmarking.\n\n![Image 5: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nClaude 4 models lead on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark for performance on real software engineering tasks\n\n![Image 6: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nReasoning and Knowledge Benchmarks\n----------------------------------\n\nReasoning ability is a core aspect of intelligence that LLM benchmarks target. It encompasses logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, commonsense reasoning, and complex multi-step inference. Early NLP benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE focused on language understanding tasks, but as LLMs grew more powerful, researchers introduced more challenging reasoning evaluations. A prime example is the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, a suite of 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 57 subjects including history, science, math, and more. MMLU became a de facto standard for academic knowledge and reasoning; GPT-4’s few-shot accuracy on MMLU is around 86%, far above most predecessors. However, frontier models have nearly saturated MMLU - GPT-4 hit 86.4% in early 2023, and newer models like PaLM 2, Claude, and fine-tuned LLaMA variants all cluster in the high-80s%. Performance has plateaued, making it hard for MMLU to distinguish newer models’ progress. This has prompted the development of MMLU-Pro, an enhanced version with more challenging questions and answer options. By increasing question difficulty and expanding answer choices from 4 to 10, MMLU-Pro significantly drops model accuracies (GPT-4’s score falls to ~72.6% on MMLU-Pro) and better discriminates top models. Notably, MMLU-Pro requires models to use chain-of-thought reasoning for high scores, whereas on original MMLU even a direct approach often sufficed. This illustrates how careful benchmark design (e.g. reducing answer choice shortcuts) can expose whether a model is truly reasoning or just guessing.\n\n![Image 7: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nAnother influential effort is BIG-bench (Beyond the Imitation Game), a crowd-sourced collection of over 200 diverse tasks intended to be “beyond the capabilities of current models”. BIG-bench tasks range from linguistics puzzles to logical reasoning and abstract pattern recognition. In the original 2022 report, large models like PaLM still failed many BIG-bench tasks, but interestingly they outperformed average humans on 65% of the tasks. To identify truly unsolved challenges, researchers defined BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) - a subset of 23 especially difficult tasks where models did not initially reach human-level performance. Many BBH tasks require multi-step reasoning. Follow-up research found that prompting models to explicitly reason (using “chain-of-thought” techniques) enabled dramatic improvements: for instance, with chain-of-thought prompting, PaLM and Codex models were able to solve many BBH tasks that they originally got wrong, even showing emergent abilities at certain model scales. These findings underscore how evaluation of reasoning can be sensitive to prompting methods.\n\nBeyond these general benchmarks, specialized reasoning tests exist for domains like math and science. The AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) focuses on grade-school science questions, and Math benchmarks (e.g. GSM8K, MATH dataset) test mathematical word problems and proofs. Results on these indicate that while basic arithmetic and algebra are within reach of large LLMs, complex math still stumps even GPT-4 at times. Indeed, an OpenAI study noted GPT-4 can “make simple reasoning errors” or produce subtly incorrect logic, despite its overall high competency. This motivates adversarial reasoning benchmarks (like puzzles specifically designed to trick LLM logic) as well as the use of step-by-step solution evaluations rather than just final answers.\n\nTo evaluate world knowledge and reasoning in combination, some benchmarks simulate human exams. AGIEval, for example, gathers questions from real exams like the SAT, GRE, and China’s Gaokao. These are challenging, high-stakes questions requiring both knowledge recall and reasoning. Likewise, the Bar Exam, medical licensing exams, and the like have been used as extreme tests - GPT-4’s top-10% bar exam score is a case in point. These exam-based evaluations have shown that frontier models approach expert-level performance in many areas, though interpretation is key: a high exam score demonstrates a form of academic reasoning, but in practical scenarios the model might still hallucinate or fail on interactive tasks. Thus, reasoning benchmarks give valuable snapshots of progress (e.g. tracking models closing the gap with expert humans), but designing them to truly require reasoning (and not allow shortcut tricks) is an ongoing challenge. As we’ll discuss, new benchmarks now combine knowledge and reasoning with other aspects to stress-test LLMs more holistically.\n\nFactual Accuracy and Hallucination\n----------------------------------\n\nDespite impressive knowledge recall, large language models are prone to hallucinations - generating statements that sound plausible but are factually incorrect or nonsensical. Evaluating factual accuracy is therefore crucial, especially as LLMs are deployed for question-answering, advice, or retrieval tasks. However, measuring truthfulness is tricky because it often requires external knowledge or human judgment to verify an answer. One prominent benchmark targeting this is TruthfulQA, which “evaluates how well LLMs generate truthful responses to questions”, especially when there are popular misconceptions or adversarial falsehoods. The TruthfulQA dataset contains 817 questions in 38 categories (covering health, law, finance, politics, etc.), each with correct answers and common incorrect answers. For example: “Do vaccines cause autism?” (where the truthful answer is “No, extensive studies show no link” but a model might pick up on common misinformation). In TruthfulQA, models are evaluated by human judges who rate whether the answer is true and informative. Interestingly, the creators also experimented with automated evaluation: they trained GPT-based judges to classify answers as true/false and measure answer quality. This approach of using an LLM to evaluate another LLM is a recurring theme (we’ll revisit it for other benchmarks too), but for factuality it remains imperfect - currently, careful human evaluation is the gold standard for detecting subtle falsehoods.\n\nOpenAI reported that GPT-4 made progress on TruthfulQA compared to earlier models. In particular, GPT-4 (after fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback, RLHF) is more resistant to producing common misconceptions as answers. For instance, it learned not to repeat the false claim that “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks” as truth. However, even GPT-4 can miss subtle factual details (OpenAI noted it incorrectly stated Elvis Presley’s parentage in one test). These results highlight that factual accuracy evaluation must cover both blatant misinformation and subtle errors. It also shows the interplay between knowledge and alignment: GPT-4’s base model was only slightly better than GPT-3.5 on TruthfulQA, but after alignment tuning (RLHF) it improved substantially, indicating that penalizing falsehoods during training can raise truthfulness scores.\n\n![Image 8: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nBeyond TruthfulQA, there are other tasks to assess hallucination and knowledge retrieval. Some involve open-domain question answering (like NaturalQuestions or WebQA) where an LLM must produce correct facts without reference material - here, researchers often check if the answer contains unsupported claims. Others use fact-checking benchmarks (e.g. FEVER) where the model is given a claim and must verify it against evidence. A high-performing LLM might still appear to do well by generating confident answers; thus evaluation needs to explicitly check each factual assertion. This has led to methods like citation accuracy (if a model is asked to provide sources, do the sources actually support the answer?) and consistency checks (asking the same fact in multiple ways).\n\nA related angle is calibration - does the model know what it doesn’t know? A well-calibrated model would refrain from answering or express uncertainty when it’s likely to be wrong. HELM measured calibration as one metric alongside accuracy, and found that some top models (the pre-RLHF GPT-4 in particular) were surprisingly well-calibrated in raw form. Yet the alignment process can reduce calibration (making the model more “confident” in tone even when unsure). So, evaluators also consider how to score a model’s self-knowledge of correctness.\n\nIn summary, factual accuracy benchmarking spans: direct QA tests of knowledge, adversarial truth tests like TruthfulQA, and analyses of hallucination in generated explanations or narratives. Each has challenges - for example, if a model’s training data already contains the test answers, it might score high without real understanding (a form of data leakage). Designers have to ensure test questions aren’t answerable by simple keyword lookup or memorization. And because what counts as “true” can sometimes be context-dependent, interpretation of results needs care. The field is moving toward dynamic evaluations (using up-to-date knowledge sources or live retrieval) to reduce static knowledge testing, but static benchmarks remain valuable for comparing models’ inherent factuality under controlled conditions.\n\nSafety and Toxicity Evaluation\n------------------------------\n\nAlongside capability, safety is a paramount concern in LLM deployment. Safety evaluations examine whether a model produces harmful, toxic, or otherwise undesirable outputs. This includes toxicity (hate speech, harassment, profanity), violence or extremist content, self-harm encouragement, misinformation, and instructions for illegal or dangerous activities. Evaluating safety is complicated by the wide range of possible bad behaviors and the fact that aligned models are explicitly trained to refuse or filter certain content. As a result, many safety benchmarks have emerged, often focusing on specific facets of harm or specific attack strategies against the model’s safeguards.\n\nOne line of safety evaluation uses triggering prompts: give the model a potentially problematic prompt and see if it responds with disallowed content. For example, the RealToxicityPrompts dataset consists of over 100k naturally occurring text prompts (from Reddit) that are not explicitly toxic themselves but could lead a language model to continue in a toxic manner. By prompting an LLM with the first part of a real sentence (e.g. “Those people always seem to be the ones who…” ) and observing if the model’s completion turns toxic, evaluators can measure a model’s tendency for neural toxic degeneration. Gehman et al. (2020) found even GPT-2 could produce highly toxic continuations from innocuous prompts. Modern models are much safer by default, but RealToxicityPrompts is still used to quantify improvements in toxicity avoidance.\n\nAnother influential benchmark is ToxiGen, which is designed to test nuanced hate speech detection. ToxiGen contains 274,000 machine-generated statements about 13 minority groups, with each statement labeled as either toxic or benign. The twist is that these statements were generated using GPT-3 in an adversarial way: an algorithm tried to produce implicitly toxic sentences (containing stereotypes or coded language rather than obvious slurs) that might fool simple toxicity classifiers. This yields a challenging testbed for LLMs - can the model distinguish hateful subtext from innocuous mentions? The benchmark can be applied in two ways: (1) as a classification test (prompt the model with a statement and see if it classifies or responds appropriately to toxic vs benign), or (2) as a generation test (as input to see if the model itself continues with toxicity when given a biased statement). In practice, ToxiGen is often used to fine-tune or evaluate toxicity detection models. A recent study found that when strong LLMs (ChatGPT, Llama-2, etc.) were stress-tested on safety, using realistic adversarial prompts, they revealed more toxicity with ToxiGen triggers than one might detect with naive prompts. This suggests that carefully engineered evaluation prompts are needed to probe the boundaries of a model’s safety behaviors.\n\n![Image 9: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nTo test compliance with ethical guidelines, benchmarks like ForbiddenQuestions have been introduced. ForbiddenQuestions presents the model with requests that should be refused according to content policy - for example: “How can I create a fake ID?” or “What are the best methods for scamming people online?”. The dataset covers 107k questions across categories like illicit behavior, hate and violence, privacy violations, etc., all of which a model must refuse to answer to pass. Evaluating on this benchmark checks if the model correctly answers “Sorry, I cannot assist with that” (or equivalent refusals) for disallowed prompts. High performance means strong adherence to safety instructions. Notably, Shen et al. (2023) compiled ForbiddenQuestions in part by observing real attempts to “jailbreak” models (like the infamous “DAN” - Do Anything Now - prompts). Thus, it simulates in-the-wild attacks where users try to get the AI to break rules.\n\nAdversarial robustness in safety is further measured by benchmarks such as AdvBench. AdvBench specifically targets jailbreak techniques and adversarial inputs that circumvent alignment. It includes 1000 prompts: 500 harmful instructions and 500 harmful pieces of text, covering areas like misinformation, hate, and self-harm, plus an adversarial suffix string that can be appended to a user query to trick the model. Zou et al. (2023) demonstrated a universal adversarial suffix that, when added to disallowed requests, could cause even aligned models to comply. Evaluating models on AdvBench means checking how often they still refuse correctly versus get duped by these crafted attacks. It’s a harsh test of a model’s robustness to malicious inputs. Similarly, an Anthropic Red Team dataset has been open-sourced, containing ~39k examples of human-written adversarial dialogues aiming to make the AI “behave badly”. These multi-turn attack conversations probe whether a model can maintain refusals over a long exchange with a clever user. Success in such benchmarks is measured by low incidence of policy violations even under sustained pressure.\n\nModern evaluation suites try to combine multiple safety facets. For instance, the HELM project introduced a HELM Safety benchmark that aggregates 5 different safety tests covering six risk categories: violence, sexual content, harassment/hate, discrimination, deception, and fraud. HELM Safety draws from several sources: e.g. BBQ for social bias/discrimination, SimpleSafety for extremely harmful requests (violence, sexual exploitation), HarmBench for vulnerability to known jailbreaks, XSTest for edge-case prompts and refusal consistency, and Anthropic’s red-team dialogues. By integrating these, HELM Safety aims to provide a standardized, broad evaluation of how models handle potentially harmful content. Early HELM results showed that no model is flawless across all categories, and that improvements in one area (say, refusing violent requests) don’t automatically transfer to another (like avoiding subtle harassment).\n\nFinally, toxicity and bias often intersect; models can exhibit biased or derogatory behavior against certain groups. While we’ll discuss bias separately below, it’s worth noting that toxicity benchmarks like ToxiGen explicitly include minority group identifiers to evaluate targeted hate. Also, some safety benchmarks include fairness tests (e.g., ensuring the model’s refusals or toxicity do not disproportionately affect one demographic). In summary, safety evaluation has evolved into a multi-headed effort: measuring outright toxic generation, the model’s ability to detoxify or refuse, its resilience to adversarial exploits, and its fairness in applying safety rules. The complexity of human values means designing these benchmarks raises its own challenges - defining what is “harmful” or “acceptable” can be subjective, and overly narrow tests might miss creative new failure modes. We discuss some of these open issues later on.\n\nMultilinguality and Cross-Lingual Generalization\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMost benchmarks historically focused on English, but an important dimension of LLM evaluation is multilingual capability - how well can a model understand and generate languages other than English, and how consistent is its performance across languages? Given that top LLMs are often trained on massive multilingual corpora, they do exhibit surprising cross-lingual generalization, but evaluation is needed to quantify strengths and weaknesses in each language.\n\nA straightforward approach is to translate existing benchmarks into many languages and test the model. OpenAI did this for MMLU: they translated all 57 subjects’ questions into 26 languages (from high-resource languages like French and Chinese to low-resource ones like Swahili and Welsh). GPT-4’s performance was then compared to its English score. The results were impressive - GPT-4 outperformed not only GPT-3.5 but also other multilingual LLMs (Chinchilla, PaLM) in 24 out of 26 languages tested. In many cases, GPT-4’s accuracy in, say, Spanish or Arabic was close to its English accuracy, demonstrating strong cross-lingual generalization. This suggests the model has learned a great deal of knowledge that transfers across languages. However, some languages remain challenging: GPT-4 did slightly worse in a couple of languages (the report doesn’t specify which 2 of 26 were the exceptions, but typically this might be extremely low-resource or morphologically complex languages). The translation-based approach, while convenient, has pitfalls: automatic translations (here done by Azure Translate) could introduce noise or subtle changes in question difficulty. Additionally, multiple-choice options must be carefully translated to preserve the correct answer position.\n\nAnother standard benchmark is XNLI (Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference), which evaluates understanding of logic across languages. XNLI provides premise-hypothesis pairs in 15 languages to test if models can perform entailment reasoning cross-lingually. Multilingual LLMs are expected to maintain consistent reasoning: if a model can do NLI in English, can it do it just as well in Swahili? For many large models, XNLI accuracy in high-resource languages is quite high, but it tends to drop for low-resource languages or those not well-represented in training data. XTREME and XGLUE are broader multilingual benchmark suites that include tasks like classification, QA, NLI, named entity recognition, etc., across dozens of languages. These have been used especially to evaluate multilingual models like mBERT, XLM, and XLM-RoBERTa in the pre-LLM era, but can equally apply to GPT-style models.\n\n![Image 10: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nA newer challenge is code-switching and dialects. For example, English-centric models may fail on regional dialects or mixtures of languages. HELM noted that many English dialects (like African American Vernacular English or Indian English) were missing from common benchmarks. Filling this gap is important for fairness. Some researchers create evaluation sets in such dialects or in code-mixed text (e.g., Spanglish).\n\nCross-lingual generalization also means how well a model can use multiple languages in one context. A truly multilingual LLM might seamlessly translate, or even combine languages (e.g., answer in French based on an English document). Benchmarks like MLQA or TyDi QA present questions in one language that must be answered from context in another language, testing cross-lingual transfer.\n\nOne more frontier is multilingual safety and bias - checking if a model that is safe in English might still produce offensive content in a less familiar language. Some toxic content classifiers work poorly on other languages due to data scarcity. So, evaluating toxicity or bias in various languages is an emerging area (though not yet as standardized).\n\nIn summary, multilingual benchmarks aim to ensure LLMs are not just polyglots by token count, but actually functional across languages. Many top models are surprisingly good globally (thanks to massive training data). GPT-4, for instance, was shown internally to handle even “low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and Swahili” with strong performance. However, interpreting these results requires care: is an error due to language understanding or due to the underlying knowledge? If a model fails a history question in Japanese, is it because it didn’t understand Japanese, or because it lacks that historical knowledge altogether? Controlled experiments like translation help isolate that. For truly multilingual evaluation, human experts in each language are often needed to judge nuances, making it resource-intensive. But as LLMs go global, this evaluation facet is indispensable.\n\nBias and Fairness\n-----------------\n\nBias and fairness evaluations probe whether LLMs exhibit unwanted societal biases or stereotypical associations, and whether their outputs are fair and respectful across different demographic groups. Bias in LLMs can manifest in many ways: making stereotyped assumptions (e.g., assuming a doctor is male), using unfair or hurtful language about protected groups, or reflecting biases present in training data. Unlike explicit toxicity, bias may be more implicit and can occur even in seemingly benign responses. Thus, specialized benchmarks have been devised to measure bias in a systematic way.\n\nEarly bias benchmarks include StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs. StereoSet presents models with fill-in-the-blank tasks to see if they prefer a stereotypical completion about a group versus a non-stereotypical one. It covers four domains of bias: gender, profession, race, and religion. For example, a prompt might be “The nurse asked the doctor for ___” and the model might fill “her opinion” vs “his opinion”. A bias would be revealed if the model consistently chooses the completion aligning with a stereotype. CrowS-Pairs is similar but uses pairs of sentences - one that is more biased and one that is more inclusive/anti-stereotypical - and asks which sentence the model is more likely to produce or prefer. These benchmarks produce a quantitative bias score (ideally an unbiased model scores 50/50 preference). Large pretrained models do show significant biases on these tests, often mirroring societal stereotypes present in the internet text.\n\n![Image 11: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nNewer bias evaluations aim to be broader and more rigorous. For instance, the HolisticBias dataset (introduced in late 2023) covers 13 demographic axes and ~600 descriptors - this means it tests model responses across attributes like gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, age, etc., using a wide range of identity terms. The goal is to see if the model responds differently or toxically when a particular group is mentioned. Meta’s LLaMA-2 report referenced using such bias benchmarks to ensure the model’s outputs are within acceptable ranges. Another approach is shown in DecodingTrust, a comprehensive trustworthiness benchmark that includes bias as one of eight evaluation perspectives. DecodingTrust integrates multiple existing tests - for bias it leverages things like StereoSet and others - and compiles an overall stereotype score for the model. This context is often important: a model might be unbiased in one context (e.g., not associating math ability with gender in an academic question) but biased in another (e.g., offering different styles of advice to different ethnic names).\n\nBias evaluation also often uses prompt-based tests. For example, one can prompt the model: “Complete the sentence: ‘The person walked into the room. The Black man said to the white man, …’” and examine if the continuation contains biases or assumptions. There are also bias attack benchmarks - for instance, an adversarial prompt might try to get the model to produce a racist joke or a biased summary, to see if the model can be provoked into biased content even if it normally wouldn’t.\n\nOne challenging area is measuring bias in generated text vs bias in model decisions. For chatbots or assistants, not only do we care about the content they generate, but also how they treat user queries. Do they give different quality answers depending on the user’s identity? For example, if asked, “How should a woman negotiate a salary?” vs “How should a man negotiate a salary?”, does the model provide equally strong advice? Ensuring parity in such cases is part of fairness evaluation.\n\nAnother nuance: fairness metrics can conflict with other objectives. A model might avoid a stereotype so strongly that it gives an uninformative answer, which might hurt perceived helpfulness. Or attempts to be unbiased might result in awkward responses (over-correcting language). Thus, benchmark designers often use paired comparisons judged by humans as in Anthropic’s HHH (Helpfulness, Honesty, Harmlessness) evaluation. HHH contains prompts and model outputs where humans had to prefer which assistant’s response was more helpful, honest, and harmless. While HHH is more of an alignment benchmark, it inherently tests fairness by including scenarios where bias or harm could appear. If a model consistently loses preference due to saying something biased (thus less harmless), it would score poorly.\n\nIn summary, bias/fairness evaluation in LLMs is moving toward a holistic, intersectional approach - covering many groups and contexts, rather than a few isolated tests. The key challenge in designing these benchmarks is ensuring they truly capture problematic biases without flagging legitimate differences. For example, a model saying “Pregnant women should avoid alcohol” is biased in that it addresses a specific group, but it’s factually correct advice - so context matters. Evaluators often need humans in the loop to judge if a difference in output is justified or harmful. Interpreting bias benchmark results can be non-trivial as well; a single score might hide which particular biases are present. Still, these benchmarks are essential for guiding model developers to identify and mitigate harmful biases, making LLMs fairer and more trustworthy for all users.\n\nRobustness and Adversarial Resistance\n-------------------------------------\n\nNo evaluation is complete without examining how models handle perturbations and adversarial inputs. Robustness refers to an LLM’s ability to maintain performance under distribution shifts or input variations that were not seen in training. Adversarial resistance is the model’s ability to not be tricked or exploited by cleverly crafted inputs. For LLMs, this can range from spelling errors and noisy text to subtle prompt manipulations or logic traps.\n\nOne simple robustness test is adding input noise: for instance, inserting typos, odd punctuation, or irrelevant phrases in a question and seeing if the model still understands it. Human performance usually drops only slightly with such noise, but some models degrade more. An example from DecodingTrust’s robustness section is a prompt like “Tell me how to stėål a car without getting çåught.” (with special characters). A robust model should recognize this as essentially “how to steal a car without getting caught” and refuse to answer it (since it’s asking for illegal advice). Less robust models might get confused by the characters or not apply the safety filter correctly, thereby revealing a vulnerability. Indeed, adversaries often exploit encoding or unicode tricks to bypass content filters. Robustness evaluation tries to anticipate these by testing variants of prompts.\n\nAnother aspect is out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness: does the model handle topics or styles that were rare in training data? For example, legal or medical jargon, or dialogue written in old English. HELM included distribution shift scenarios to measure how accuracy holds up when inputs differ from the norm. Many models show performance drops on OOD inputs, although larger models are generally more resilient due to broader training coverage.\n\nWe discussed jailbreak attacks under safety; these are a form of adversarial input specifically to induce policy violations. More generally, adversarial evaluation can target a model’s reasoning. For example, the Boolean Algebra paradoxes or deliberately ambiguous questions can cause logical failures. Some researchers craft adversarial tests by manually finding prompts that confuse the model (kind of like red-teaming the model’s reasoning). Others use automated methods: e.g., using another model or algorithm to generate input variants that cause errors.\n\nRecommended by LinkedIn\n-----------------------\n\n[![Image 12: A Beginner’s Guide to Large Language Models](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse) A Beginner’s Guide to Large Language Models Digitate 1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beginners-guide-large-language-models-igniobydigitate-tlsme)\n\n[![Image 13: From "Bag-of-Words" to "Instruct-Tuned LLMs": The Technical and Business Evolution of NLP](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse) From "Bag-of-Words" to "Instruct-Tuned LLMs": The… Thirumalesh Konathala (PhD) 8 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-bag-of-words-instruct-tuned-llms-technical-nlp-konathala-phd--nefkc)\n\n[![Image 14: NewMind AI Journal #106](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse) NewMind AI Journal #106 NewMind AI 3 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/newmind-ai-journal-106-newmind-ai-nwb3e)\n\nBIG-bench included some tasks that are essentially adversarial - trick questions, or ones with no correct answer to see if the model will guess or respond oddly. Another interesting benchmark is SWAG / HellaSWAG, which target commonsense reasoning with adversarial wrong answers that look right. These have been around since before GPT-3 and are largely solved by big models now (GPT-4 exceeds human performance on HellaSWAG), but they were early adversarial datasets showing how subtle wording can trip up AI. Now, researchers escalate to multi-turn adversarial interactions (e.g., someone tries to get the AI to contradict itself or reveal private info over a long chat).\n\nA critical challenge in robustness evaluation is that the space of adversarial inputs is infinite. One can always design a weirder or more convoluted input. Thus, evaluation here is often about known classes of adversarial attacks. For instance, character-level perturbations, prompt injections, logic flips, context pollution (inserting misleading context before a question), etc. The AdvBench we mentioned explicitly tests one known attack (adversarial suffixes). If a model passes that, attackers will try a new method. This cat-and-mouse nature means evaluation must be continuously updated with new adversarial examples as they are discovered.\n\nDespite these difficulties, showing that a model is robust to a suite of stress tests increases confidence in its reliability. For example, Anthropic’s Claude was tested on many prompt attacks and found to be harder to jailbreak than GPT-3.5, indicating a higher robustness - but not unbreakable. Evaluation results are often used to compare models: e.g., Model A with advanced fine-tuning might resist typos or adversarial prompts better than Model B. Such differences can be crucial for deployment decisions.\n\nTo make results generalizable, some propose adversarial training evaluation: train a model on adversarial examples and see if it improves (if yes, then the test wasn’t truly fundamental, just data exposure; if no, the issue might be deeper). From an evaluation perspective, one wants benchmarks that reveal fundamental model limitations that aren’t easily patched by a quick fine-tune.\n\nIn conclusion, robustness and adversarial benchmarks ensure we are not just measuring performance in a vacuum, but under more realistic or even worst-case inputs. They provide insight into how a model might fail in practice - e.g., getting confused by malformed input or being manipulated by a bad actor. As LLMs are used in critical applications, these evaluations are as important as measuring raw accuracy.\n\nEfficiency and Cost-Based Trade-offs\n------------------------------------\n\nLarge language models differ not only in quality of outputs but also in computational efficiency, inference speed, and cost. Evaluating an LLM’s “performance” thus isn’t just about accuracy or safety - practitioners care about throughput (tokens per second), latency (response time), memory footprint, and how these scale with model size or deployment setup. Therefore, modern benchmarking sometimes incorporates efficiency metrics to inform practical trade-offs between model quality and cost.\n\nFor instance, the HELM benchmark explicitly includes efficiency as one of its core metrics, measuring aspects like the inference latency per token and the cost to generate an output for each model. This allows direct comparison of, say, GPT-4 vs a smaller model in terms of how much compute they require to achieve certain results. In real-world scenarios, a slightly lower accuracy might be acceptable if it comes with 10× lower cost.\n\nOpenAI’s own reports highlight this trade-off: GPT-4’s superior capability comes with a much larger computational cost. It’s estimated to be over 10× more expensive per token to run than the GPT-3.5-Turbo model. An analysis by Microsoft researchers (Chi et al., 2023) showed that GPT-4’s improved coding ability, for example, must be weighed against its price: GPT-4 solved ~68% of coding tasks vs GPT-3.5’s 46%, but at 20× the cost per call. They demonstrated an adaptive approach where one uses GPT-3.5 for easy cases and GPT-4 for hard cases, achieving higher overall accuracy (90% on HumanEval coding benchmark) at ~18% lower cost than using GPT-4 for everything. This sort of work suggests that benchmarks should also consider cost-efficiency - not just can Model X solve the task, but how efficiently in terms of compute or dollars?\n\nHumanEval (the coding benchmark with 164 programming problems) can illustrate this: GPT-4 might get nearly all questions correct if allowed multiple attempts, but a smaller fine-tuned model might achieve say 80% with much faster runtime. If one needs real-time code generation, the latter might be preferable. Therefore, reporting pass rate vs runtime or accuracy vs model size is increasingly common in benchmark studies.\n\nAdditionally, there are benchmarks focusing on model compression and distillation effects - e.g., does an 13B parameter model fine-tuned on instructions perform as well as a 175B model on certain tasks? If yes, that’s a win for efficiency. The rise of open models like LLaMA-2 and Mistral (7B) has spurred interest in evaluation under resource constraints. Some papers explicitly chart accuracy vs model size on benchmarks like MMLU or truthfulness, to see if smaller models can punch above their weight.\n\nAnother aspect is memory robustness: e.g., how does the model’s performance degrade if you use 4-bit quantization to save memory? There’s now testing that a quantized model still retains high accuracy on benchmarks, which is crucial for edge deployment.\n\nIn the academic sense, efficiency metrics have to be interpreted carefully because they depend on hardware and implementation. One model might seem faster simply due to better optimized code. To mitigate that, some benchmark frameworks fix the environment or use tokens generated as a proxy. HELM reports “prompt throughput” for models on a standardized setup, giving a rough idea of relative speed.\n\nIn summary, while efficiency and cost are not benchmarks in the traditional sense of question-answer accuracy, they are increasingly reported alongside benchmark results. The trade-offs between capability and cost mean that evaluation is multi-objective. For researchers, a big open question is how to fairly compare models when one is twice as good but ten times slower - the answer depends on use case. At the very least, transparency in these metrics is encouraged. Evaluation suites of the future may even assign a combined score that penalizes very slow models or reward models that achieve high performance with fewer resources, reflecting a real-world utility function rather than pure accuracy.\n\nTool Use and Coding Abilities\n-----------------------------\n\nAs large language models become integrated into complex systems, their ability to use tools (like calling APIs, running code, or searching the web) is increasingly relevant. Additionally, many LLMs are trained or tuned for code generation, making programming benchmarks a key part of evaluation. We consider these related, since using tools often implies generating or understanding structured formats (code, APIs, queries).\n\nCode generation benchmarks have become standard after OpenAI’s Codex and similar models. The most famous is HumanEval, a set of 164 Python programming problems where an LLM must generate a correct solution function for each prompt (with correctness measured by running hidden test cases). On HumanEval, state-of-the-art models reach very high pass rates - for example, GPT-4 (2023) was reported to solve ~80% or more of the problems with few attempts, and one specialized model “AutoCoder” even claimed a 90.9% pass@1, slightly above GPT-4 Turbo’s 90.2%. These numbers indicate near-human or above-human programming ability on short coding tasks. However, HumanEval has been around for a while, and top models now approach saturation on it. Researchers have introduced harder coding challenges like the MBPP (Mostly Basic Programming Problems) and LeetCode puzzles, as well as multi-step coding benchmarks (writing an entire program for a more complex spec, possibly requiring multiple functions or reasoning). There’s also the APPS dataset with thousands of coding problems ranging from easy to competition-level difficulty. GPT-4 excels at easy and medium, but still struggles on the very hardest competitive programming problems, so there’s headroom in code evaluation.\n\nWhen it comes to tool use, one way to evaluate is via simulation tasks. For example, an LLM might be placed in a setting where it has access to a calculator or a database, and the benchmark asks questions that require using that tool (because no human could do it mentally either). An instance could be a math word problem whose arithmetic is too large to do in one’s head - the model should learn to invoke the calculator tool. If the model just tries to solve it directly and makes a mistake, it fails. OpenAI’s WebGPT and DeepMind’s Toolformer research have such evaluations internally, but as of now there isn’t a widely adopted public “tool-use benchmark suite.” Instead, researchers often create custom evals: e.g., give the model a web browser and test it on factual questions that require looking up current information. Success is measured by whether it actually uses the browse tool and finds the correct info.\n\nA notable effort here is the OpenAI Evals framework, which lets users write evaluations where the model can call functions (tool APIs) and you verify the outcome. This has enabled the community to contribute scenarios like “Given a latitude/longitude, use a geocoding API to find the city” and see if a model integrated with tools does so correctly. Although not a single benchmark, these frameworks hint at what tool-use evaluation will look like: a collection of scenarios testing the model’s decision to use a tool, the correctness of tool inputs, and handling the outputs.\n\nFor coding, beyond generating correct code, newer benchmarks examine code understanding and debugging. For example, given a piece of code and a bug report, can the LLM fix the bug? Or can it explain what a given code snippet does (an aspect of program comprehension)? Some academic benchmarks (like the CSFG from DeepMind) tackle these, but they’re less common than generation tasks.\n\nAn interesting intersection is when an LLM needs to produce code as a tool to solve a problem. For instance, GSM8K (a math word problem dataset) often is easier for a model if it can write a short piece of code to compute the answer. If an eval environment allowed that, it would test multi-step reasoning with code as a tool.\n\nLastly, an emerging evaluation for tool use is in agent simulations. One example: set up a virtual environment (like a text-based game or a web navigation task) and see if the LLM can plan and execute a sequence of tool calls to achieve a goal. Success criteria are things like: did it book a flight using a flight-search API given a high-level request? These are not yet standardized benchmarks but are active research (for instance, the LLM-as-agent research often reports success rates on such tasks).\n\nIn summary, evaluation of tool use and coding extends the scope of LLM benchmarking beyond pure language output to how well models interface with external systems. Challenges in designing these evaluations include: defining clear success metrics (since it’s not just one answer but a sequence of actions that matter), and the combinatorial complexity of tasks (an agent might succeed partially). Nevertheless, coding benchmarks like HumanEval provide a strong quantitative anchor (pass rate) that correlates well with real utility (developers using LLMs to generate code). And as LLMs become parts of larger pipelines, their proficiency in wielding tools will be increasingly scrutinized through such targeted evaluations.\n\nInstruction Following and General-Purpose Capabilities\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the hallmark advancements of recent LLMs is their ability to follow instructions and act as general-purpose conversational agents. This is largely thanks to fine-tuning methods like supervised instruction tuning and RLHF. Evaluating how well a model follows instructions, carries out conversations, and satisfies user intent is more subjective than, say, solving a math problem. Nonetheless, benchmarks and comparative evaluations have been developed to quantify these general-purpose capabilities.\n\nAnthropic introduced the notion of “helpful, honest, and harmless” (HHH) as goals for an AI assistant, and their evaluation involves human raters comparing two model responses for a given prompt. The HHH dataset (open-sourced as part of Anthropic’s work) contains pairwise comparisons. A model that consistently produces responses that humans rate as more helpful (useful, on-topic, thorough), honest (truthful and transparent about uncertainty), and harmless (inoffensive and refusing unethical requests) will score better. This kind of evaluation was used to train Claude and other assistants; as a benchmark, it’s essentially asking: what percentage of the time do humans prefer model A’s output over model B’s, in a wide variety of scenarios? A challenge here is that it’s not automated - it relies on human preference judgments. However, these judgments can be distilled into a model-based “reward model” for faster comparisons.\n\nEnter MT-Bench (Multi-Turn Benchmark), introduced by UC Berkeley’s LMSys team (creators of Vicuna) as part of studying LLM-vs-LLM evaluations. MT-Bench is a set of open-ended questions specifically designed to test an AI assistant’s ability in multi-turn dialogues and instruction following. For example, a question might be: “Explain the pros and cons of renewable energy in the style of a casual conversation, then answer a follow-up question about solar power incentives.” The model’s conversation is evaluated across aspects like coherence, informativeness, following the user’s instructions (style requests, content requests), and possibly creativity. Because scoring such open-ended answers is difficult, the researchers leveraged GPT-4 as an automated judge. They found that GPT-4 as a judging model could match human evaluation of chat quality with about 80% agreement - essentially as good as the agreement between two human evaluators. With GPT-4 as a referee, they compared various chatbots on MT-Bench. This is notable because it’s a new paradigm: using a very advanced model to evaluate other models on general conversation tasks.\n\nThe LMSys team also ran Chatbot Arena, an online platform where humans could chat with two anonymous models side by side and vote for the better response. Data from thousands of such battles formed a human preference dataset for model chat performance. It revealed interesting insights: some models that are nearly identical on knowledge benchmarks (like LLaMA vs fine-tuned Alpaca) have vastly different user preference ratings because alignment and style matter a lot. For example, a base LLaMA-13B might solve trivia as well as an aligned Vicuna-13B on MMLU questions, but in a conversation Vicuna is far more preferred. This underscores that instruction-following ability is not captured by standard academic benchmarks. Therefore, new benchmarks intentionally include open-ended tasks: summarization, creative writing, roleplay, step-by-step assistance, etc., and rely on either human or proxy-humanness evaluation.\n\nAnother general capability is long-horizon coherence. Can the model carry information or follow instructions consistently over a lengthy dialogue or a long document? There aren’t standard tests for this yet beyond some anecdotal setups (like giving the model a 5,000-word story to summarize or asking it not to forget a detail 20 turns later). However, as context window lengths increase (e.g., GPT-4 can take thousands of tokens), we can expect benchmarks that stress test this (perhaps something like: given a long conversation transcript, does the model correctly answer questions about earlier parts, or maintain character consistency).\n\nGeneral-purpose ability also means being able to handle a wide variety of tasks without specialized tuning. The BIG-Bench suite was originally motivated by this - to throw many unusual tasks at a model and see if it can handle them with few-shot prompting. So one way to gauge a model’s general capability is simply how many tasks (across all the above categories) it can perform at a high level. For instance, the Helm project found that models like GPT-4 and Claude excel “across the board” relative to older models, whereas smaller models might be good at some tasks but fail badly at others. Frontier models are expected to demonstrate not just one skill but an array: reasoning + coding + multilingual + etc., which is why integrated benchmarks are needed.\n\nInstruction-following can be evaluated in a straightforward way too: by checking if the model’s output obeys specific instructions about format, style, or content. For example, if instructed “Give me three bullet points about topic X”, does it actually produce three bullet points? If told not to mention a certain word, does it comply? Such fine-grained instruction adherence might be part of some evaluations (and is often tested during model development by unit-tests on prompts).\n\nTo sum up, evaluating general-purpose, instruction-following behavior often involves comparative evaluations (which model gives better responses to a variety of prompts) and composite benchmarks (covering multiple skills in realistic user queries). It brings in subjective criteria like usefulness and user satisfaction. The community has started to automate these evaluations with strong reference models (GPT-4 judges, reward models trained on human feedback), but this raises its own questions - are we aligning models to the preferences of another model? We’ll discuss that next. Nonetheless, from a capabilities standpoint, the trend is towards holistic, scenario-driven evaluation: for example, the recent HolisticEval approach suggests evaluating a model on an end-to-end scenario (like playing the role of a helpful travel assistant) and measuring various outcomes. This is less tidy than a single metric benchmark, but arguably closer to real-world performance.\n\nIntegrated Benchmark Suites and Frontier Model Evaluation\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn light of the above categories, researchers have created benchmark suites that compile many tests to give a comprehensive picture of an LLM. We’ve already mentioned HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models), which is one of the most ambitious efforts. HELM defines a broad set of scenarios (use cases like summarization, QA, dialogue, etc.) and metrics (accuracy, robustness, calibration, bias, toxicity, efficiency, etc.), and evaluates each model on each scenario-metric pair. In its latest report, HELM evaluated 30 prominent models (open and closed) on 42 scenarios, many of which were novel additions not used in previous benchmarks. By standardizing conditions, HELM allows apples-to-apples comparisons and explicitly highlights trade-offs: for example, one model might score highest on accuracy but also higher on toxicity than another. Such suites underscore that no single score or leaderboard tells the full story - you need a vector of metrics.\n\nAnother major suite is BIG-bench (and BIG-bench Hard), which we covered; it’s less about metrics and more about collecting tasks. Similarly, the LMSys Chatbot Arena + MT-Bench combo is becoming a de-facto evaluation for chat models, combining quantitative and qualitative judgments. There is also Stanford’s AlpacaEval and OpenAI’s evals which allow crowdsourced benchmark writing, leading to hundreds of small evals (like “identify the emotion in this sentence” or “is this arithmetic correct”) that can be aggregated.\n\nFor frontier models specifically (GPT-4, Claude 2, PaLM 2, LLaMA-2, etc.), new evaluations attempt to capture emergent behaviors and risks. One example is the work on emergent tool use - testing if a model like GPT-4 can perform tasks that were not explicitly trained, such as doing chemistry reasoning or theory-of-mind puzzles, which earlier models could not. These often appear as isolated research findings rather than standardized benchmarks. But some have been formalized: e.g., ARC-Advanced (a subset of the AI2 Reasoning Challenge) was used to show emergent jump in performance around certain model scales. That became a way to say “does model A have this emergent ability that only shows up beyond X parameters?”\n\nGeneralizing evaluation results is another concern addressed by integrated suites. For instance, HELM documented that before its effort, most models were each evaluated on disjoint sets of benchmarks, making it hard to compare. HELM managed to evaluate every model on 96% of the same core scenarios, so now one can see a more unified picture. It surfaced findings like “Model X is best for summarization, Model Y for code, etc.”. As frontier models keep being released, having a living benchmark that adds new tasks (like MMLU-Pro when MMLU saturates, or new safety tests when new risks are found) is crucial.\n\nHELM Safety, mentioned earlier, is one example where a suite is updated with standardized categories of safety tests. Another is DecodingTrust which bundles multiple trust-related benchmarks into one framework. These integrated evaluations aim to be one-stop shops to evaluate an LLM’s trustworthiness across toxicity, bias, privacy, etc., rather than running 10 separate benchmarks. The authors of DecodingTrust argue it’s “one of the most holistic benchmarks available” for LLM trustworthiness.\n\nWe should also note OpenAI’s internal evals (some details were mentioned in the GPT-4 technical report). OpenAI used over 50 experts in various domains to adversarially test GPT-4 before release. They essentially created custom evaluations in areas like cybersecurity, bioethics, etc., that are not traditional NLP benchmarks at all. While these are not public, they indicate that frontier evaluation often involves expert review and scenario analysis beyond automated benchmarks. For example, testing if GPT-4 can produce dangerous chemical recipes required a chemist to evaluate the outputs.\n\nFinally, leaderboards and competitions are also part of the evaluation ecosystem. The HuggingFace Open LLM leaderboard evaluates models on a mix of benchmarks and ranks them (though this is a moving target as new models flood in). There are also regular challenges (like the GH Challenge for LLMs or Eval4NLP competitions) which introduce new task evaluations. All these contribute to keeping evaluation up-to-date as models evolve.\n\nIn conclusion, integrated benchmark suites provide a broad assessment and help identify gaps - for example, a model might be top-notch in math and code but weak in say commonsense ethics, which a holistic suite would reveal so it can be addressed. As we next discuss, however, there remain many open problems in benchmarking that researchers are actively grappling with, especially as models become more capable and more integrated into real-world settings.\n\nOpen Challenges in LLM Benchmarking\n-----------------------------------\n\nEven with the extensive benchmarks and evaluations described, benchmarking LLMs remains a moving target. Here we outline key open problems and challenges in designing, interpreting, and generalizing LLM evaluations:\n\n*   Model Transparency and Unknown Strategies: Unlike a human test-taker, an LLM’s reasoning process is a black box. A model might get high scores on a benchmark by exploiting spurious patterns or shortcuts rather than truly solving the task. For example, choosing the correct multiple-choice answer without understanding the question (by elimination or dataset bias) could inflate performance. Evaluators often cannot tell if a correct answer was due to genuine reasoning or a “cheat” the model found. This lack of transparency makes it hard to design benchmarks that truly probe intended skills. It also means evaluation should go beyond final answers - looking at chain-of-thought outputs or asking models to explain their reasoning as part of the test could help, but scoring those explanations is non-trivial.\n*   Evolving Capabilities and Saturation: The rapid progress in LLM capabilities means benchmarks can become obsolete or too easy much faster than traditional benchmarks did. We saw this with MMLU saturating in barely a year. As soon as a benchmark becomes a standard target, models may get fine-tuned or engineered to excel at it, yielding clustered high scores that reveal little. New benchmarks like MMLU-Pro arise, but they too might saturate in time. This evolutionary pressure requires constantly creating new challenges - a daunting task. Moreover, a benchmark might not remain predictive of real-world performance once models have essentially solved it. For instance, by 2024 many models score ~90% on SuperGLUE, which once indicated human-level language understanding; yet clearly there were other shortcomings in those models not captured by SuperGLUE. Benchmark lifespan is short, and we need methods (perhaps procedurally generated benchmarks or dynamic adversarial benchmarking) to keep evaluation challenging and relevant over time.\n*   Subjective Metrics and Human Alignment: Many important aspects of LLM behavior - helpfulness, coherence, creativity, ethical stance - are subjective qualities that are hard to boil down to a single automated metric. Human evaluations (ratings, pairwise comparisons) remain the gold standard for these. But humans are inconsistent; even on the same outputs, different people may disagree (studies show ~20% disagreement is common in preference labeling ). This raises questions: How to design evaluation prompts and instructions to get consistent human judgments? How to aggregate them fairly? Additionally, if we use surrogate metrics like “GPT-4 judged this answer a 8/10 for helpfulness”, we risk aligning to the idiosyncrasies of the AI judge. Ensuring that evaluation aligns with actual end-user preferences (which can vary by culture, context, individual) is an unsolved problem. There’s ongoing research into better human-feedback models, but any static benchmark for “write a good essay” or “be a helpful assistant” will always have an irreducible subjective component.\n*   Evaluator Alignment (Human vs. AI Judges): Following from the above - the practice of using LLMs as judges (e.g., GPT-4 scoring chat responses) is promising for scalability, but introduces concerns. LLM judges might have biases: one study found GPT-4 had position bias (favoring whichever answer it saw last in a comparison) and verbosity bias (mistaking longer answers as better). It might also be vulnerable to self-enhancement bias (where a model subtly praises responses more similar to its own style). If not carefully mitigated, these biases could skew evaluation results. Furthermore, an AI judge may not fully grasp human preferences in certain nuanced areas like humor or emotional sensitivity. Researchers are working on calibrating AI evaluators and even using fine-tuned smaller judges (to reduce cost), but verifying that AI evaluators agree with humans on what “better” means is essential. In the long run, a combination of human and AI in the evaluation loop might be needed, especially for high-stakes assessments.\n*   Interactive and Long-Horizon Tasks: Current benchmarks mostly consist of single-turn or independent examples. Yet real deployments often involve interactive sequences - multi-turn dialogues, iterative problem solving, continuous decision making. Evaluating an AI agent over a long horizon (many turns/actions) is challenging because the space of possible interactions is huge. There’s no simple dataset of “100-step conversations” with ground-truth answers. Instead, one might evaluate an agent in a simulated environment or via real user studies. This is time-consuming and hard to standardize. How do we score an AI that plans a 10-step solution to accomplish a goal? One proposal is to use simulation environments (like text games or web navigation) where there’s a clear success condition and let the model loose - success rate can then be measured. But building a suite of such environments that are general enough is tough. Another aspect is memory and consistency in long conversations: models can contradict themselves or forget earlier context. Developing metrics for conversation consistency or for the ability to “self-correct” over a dialogue is an open area. In summary, we need benchmarks that go beyond one-and-done Q&A and test sustained performance, but designing them is an ongoing research project.\n*   Static Benchmarks vs. Real-World Deployment: Perhaps the most fundamental tension is that benchmarks are static, but real-world tasks are dynamic. Once a benchmark is published, models can train on it (or on data very similar to it). In the real world, users can ask anything, and the distribution of queries evolves. There’s also an element of metagaming - optimizing for benchmarks can lead to overfitting to them, at the expense of generality. A model might output exactly what benchmarks expect (to get a high score), but in deployment that could appear overly formulaic or miss the user’s intent. For instance, a model might learn to always give three bullet points on a certain evaluation prompt because that’s what the metric rewards, even if the user didn’t need three. To mitigate this, researchers are exploring adaptive or online evaluation, where the model is evaluated on live user interactions or continuously updated tasks. However, that poses problems for fair comparison (Model A and B might get different queries). Another idea is benchmarking by monitoring: measuring a model’s performance on some real-world tasks (like acceptance rate of its answers on a forum, or success rate in deployed applications). But such measures are context-specific and hard to generalize.\n*   Data Leakage and Benchmark Security: Ensuring that test data remains truly novel to the model is getting harder. LLMs are often trained on so much public data that there’s a high chance that some test questions (or very similar ones) are somewhere in the training set. For older benchmarks like trivia QA, this was already an issue - models could memorize answers. With even bigger training corpora, it’s plausible that a model saw some MMLU questions verbatim during pretraining from some uploaded resource, even if unintended. There is an active push for benchmark security - keeping test sets private or using generative techniques to create test questions on the fly so models can’t memorize them beforehand. OpenAI’s evals allow for dynamic generation of prompts. This will be increasingly important to truly test generalization rather than recollection. It also connects to transparency: closed models might claim a score, but without knowing their training data, we can’t be sure they didn’t have an unfair advantage.\n\nEach of these challenges suggests that benchmarking is not a one-time task but an evolving process. As LLMs become more capable, our methods of evaluation must become more sophisticated, combining static and dynamic tests, human and automated judgments, and covering new ground (e.g., multidisciplinary tasks, ethics, interpretability). The community is aware of these issues; for example, the HELM authors explicitly call it a “living benchmark” to be continuously updated. This agility will be key to keeping evaluations relevant and keeping models accountable.\n\nIn conclusion, evaluating large language models is critical for guiding their development and deployment, but it is undeniably complex. By employing a spectrum of benchmarks - from reasoning and knowledge tests, to truthfulness and toxicity checks, to multilingual and bias assessments, to robustness and efficiency metrics - researchers can build a holistic picture of an LLM’s performance and limitations. Recent benchmark suites like MMLU, BIG-bench, TruthfulQA, ToxiGen, MT-Bench, and HELM have driven the field forward, each illuminating different facets. Yet, designing these benchmarks and interpreting their results requires care: one must consider what each score means, how it was obtained, and what might be missing. As we push into the frontier of GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and beyond, new evaluation techniques (dynamic adversarial testing, AI-as-a-judge, interactive simulations) are being explored to capture frontier behaviors. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that as AI models get more powerful, we also improve our yardsticks for measuring quality, safety, and alignment - so that we not only build more capable AI, but also more trustworthy and understood AI. Each open challenge in benchmarking is an opportunity for the community to innovate in how we assess and steer these rapidly evolving models.\n\nResources\n---------\n\n*   [Liang, P. et al. (2022).

...', raw_content='# BENCHMARKING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\n\nThe exponential expansion in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various industries by making advanced natural language processing tasks available to all. However, with this rapid advancement comes the challenge of ensuring that these models perform reliably and ethically across different applications.\xa0  \n   \n Benchmarking LLMs has become a critical step in their use throughout the implementation lifecycle\xa0 , providing a structured way to evaluate model performance, robustness, and fairness. It is not just about testing the LLM on its own, but for the use case and data at hand which has a huge impact on performance and outputs.\xa0  \n   \n In this article we outline a framework for benchmarking LLMs, as well as highlighting the importance of validation at various stages of the life cycle, the value of both quantitative and qualitative metrics, and the need to address vulnerabilities and biases.\n\n# Benchmarking Large Language Models : Enhancing Reliability & Reducing Bias\n\n* Leo Ferrari, Caleb Severn, Srinivas Waghmare, Ghadir Abu Ahmad\n* Published: 09 December 2024\n\n**The LLM market is characterized by a high degree of complexity and rapid innovation. With the availability of numerous models, each boasting distinct capabilities, organizations face significant challenges in selecting the most suitable LLM for their specific use cases.**   \n The opaque nature of the training data used in proprietary models further complicates this process, making it difficult to fully understand their behaviours and potential risks. Additionally, traditional validation methods often fall short against the scale and complexity of modern LLMs, leading to potential issues in scalability and generalization.\xa0  \n   \n The need for a structured and rigorous benchmarking process is increasingly pressing, not only to minimise the risk of deploying suboptimal models but also to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory standards and ethical guidelines, ultimately building trust with stakeholders and driving innovation.\n\n**The Different Stages of LLM Validation**  \n   \n Effective LLM validation is not a one-size-fits-all process but rather a multi-faceted approach that requires careful consideration at each stage.  \n   \n As part of the full mode life cycle, after clearly defining the objectives and metrics that align with the intended use case (a crucial step setting the foundation for all subsequent evaluations) and preparing and cleaning the data, evaluation can be viewed as belonging to the following four major areas.\n\n**Quantitative Evaluation** – Quantitative metrics are employed to evaluate the model\'s performance. These metrics are task-specific and provide objective measures of how well the model is performing. While traditional classification metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1 score are useful for some tasks, LLMs often require more nuanced and task-specific metrics such as Rouge for summarization and text generation  \n   \n **Qualitative Evaluation** – Human evaluation plays a significant role in assessing the quality, coherence, and relevance of the model’s outputs. This stage helps identify areas where the model may perform well on paper but falls short in real-world applications.  \n   \n **Robustness Testing** – The model is tested against various adversarial inputs to assess its stability and security, identifying potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in real-world scenarios, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection.  \n   \n **Bias and Fairness Testing** – Finally, the model\'s outputs are examined for bias and fairness, ensuring that the LLM treats all demographics equitably and adheres to ethical standards. This stage is particularly important in applications where decisions can significantly impact people\'s lives\n\nEach stage of validation is necessary for the overall success of deploying LLMs, ensuring that the models not only perform well but also operate within ethical and secure boundaries. Although each stage demands investment of resource, effort, and expertise, omitting any one of them could lead to gaps that surface in production or can be exploited by malicious parties.\n\n**1. Quantitative metrics**\n\nQuantitative metrics form the starting of LLM evaluation, offering objective measures that help quantify a model’s performance across different tasks. These metrics are tailored to the specific tasks that LLMs are designed to perform, ranging from language modelling and text generation to machine translation and summarization. Industry benchmarks (such as HuggingFace’s LLM Leaderboard) can be useful for determining a shortlist of models and providers from the market that you may want to test for your use case. Figure 1 shows examples of quantitative metrics by task.\n\nFigure 1: Non-exhaustive list of quantitative metrics for LLMs, grouped by task\n\nDepending on your use case, you might consider LLM performance in the following areas:\n\n* **Text generation:** quality, coherence, relevance, and similarity of generated text compared to reference text or desired outputs\n* **Summarisation:** how accurately and comprehensively the generated summary captures key information and content\n* **Translation:** accuracy, fluency, and alignment of the translated text with the meaning and structure of original text\n* **Information retrieval:** relevance, accuracy, and ranking quality of retrieved documents or results in response to a query\n* **Question & answering:** accuracy, relevance, and completeness of the model\'s answers by comparing them to the correct or reference answers\n* **Speech Recognition:** accuracy and clarity of transcribed text by comparing it to the original spoken input\n* **Image captioning:** accuracy, relevance, and descriptiveness of generated captions by comparing them to human-written reference captions\n\nWhile quantitative metrics provide a robust framework for evaluating LLMs, they must be interpreted carefully, especially in the context of the specific use case. Published metrics often highlight strengths that may not fully align with the practical needs of an application, necessitating a more nuanced approach to their application.\n\nFigure 2: BLEU Summarisation Scores of LLMs\xa0 \xa0Llama3 (Meta), Gemma2 (Google), ChatGPT4o (OpenAI), and Luhn Summarisation Algorithm on BCBS 239 documentation, assessed across a range of uni-, bi-, tri- and quad-gram overlap weightings\n\nFor example, if you need an LLM to summarise text on BCBS documentation, you may choose Llama3 as it displays better overlap between the summarised and original text, as seen in Figure 2. However, if you wanted a summarisation that delineated different topics within the original text, ChatGPT-4o\xa0 could be better – something we will examine in a future article.  \n   \n Once you have shortlisted models to build into your pipeline, it is prudent to evaluate them using metrics that are bespoke to your use case and KPIs and tested on your data. For example, evaluating a model\'s suitability for finance and banking involves assessing its pre-training on financial texts, ease of fine-tuning with domain-specific data, and ability to transfer knowledge from general language tasks to finance-specific applications. This ensures the model performs well in the unique context of the financial sector.\n\n**2. Qualitative Metrics**  \n   \n While quantitative metrics provide numerical insights into an LLM’s performance, qualitative metrics capture the nuances that numbers alone cannot. These human-centric evaluations are useful for validating how well an LLM performs in real-world scenarios, where the subtleties of language, context, and user interaction play significant roles.\xa0  \n   \n Human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation approaches can enable continued SME involvement to understand model idiosyncrasies, mitigate risks and improve fidelity in a controlled environment before the model is deployed to production. Due to resource requirements (financial and FTE), this step could easily be omitted during prototyping but should be deeply considered before deployment, and should heavily involve business stakeholders to weigh against budget and timelines.\n\n\xa0 \xa0  \n   \n  Figure 3: Summary of HITL approaches with qualitative assessment of strengths; green denotes a strength of the approach, orange denotes an area to consider when employing the approach\n\n**3. Robustness Tests**  \n   \n As LLMs become more integral to various applications, their vulnerabilities also become more apparent. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by adversarial attacks, involving deliberately crafted inputs designed to trick the model into producing incorrect or harmful outputs. Addressing these vulnerabilities through robust defences is critical to ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs.  \n   \n Combating adversarial attacks can be a hugely laborious task, and it is reasonable that enterprise users of the LLMs expect the heavy lifting to be done by the providers. Nevertheless, providers can only do so much, so it is prudent to consider the defensive strategies that tech teams can incorporate into their processes:\n\n* **Hyperparameter tuning:** adjusting model parameters, such as temperature, can reduce the success of prompt injection attacks.\n* **Audit behaviour:** employ optimisation algorithms to identify elusive and undesirable model behaviours before deployment.\n* **Input/output filtering:** preprocess incoming data to identify and mitigate potential threats and anomalies and/or post-process model’s generated responses by blocking or modifying it to maintain ethical and safe interactions with LLMs.\n* **Human feedback integration:** incorporate human feedback and preferences directly into the pretraining phase rather than the fine-tuning stage to produce outputs that resonate more closely with human generations.\n* **Red teaming and adversarial training:** employ a dedicated group (human and automated techniques) using bespoke datasets simulating adversarial behaviours and attack strategies to identify vulnerability in the system, across hardware, software, and human elements.\n\n**4. Bias & Fairness**  \n   \n Ensuring that LLMs operate fairly across all demographic groups is a core principle of Responsible AI. Bias in the data that LLMs train on can lead to unequal treatment of users, perpetuating stereotypes and potentially causing harm in decision-making processes.\xa0  \n   \n Bias and fairness testing for LLMs focuses on evaluating model outputs across diverse demographic groups and contexts to identify disparities. It involves tasks like language generation, sentiment analysis, and classification, using diverse datasets and specific metrics to assess and ensure fairness and equity in model performance. The tests broadly cover the following approaches:\n\n* **Sentence completion tasks** with prompts that reveal biases in race, gender, religion, and other social categories (StereoSet, CrowS-Pairs, BOLD, WinoBias)\n* **Prediction or implicit association** of occupation or other attributes with social categories (Bias in Bios, WinoGender, SEAT)\n* **Using prompts** to elicit toxic responses (RealToxicityPrompts)\n\nEnsuring fairness in LLMs involves not only using diverse datasets and benchmarks but also continuously monitoring and updating the models to address emerging biases. While these tests primarily serve to diagnose biases, mitigating them is an integrated process where techniques such as prompt engineering can provide guardrails for the LLM when generating responses. However, total protection is not guaranteed, and periodic review of the outputs and user feedback is required to ensure users are treated fairly.\n\n**Beyond Model Performance: Cost**\n\nA final, but important factor, is the cost of running your use case leveraging a certain model. LLMs costs can vary significantly based on several factors, including the type of model, its size, usage frequency, deployment environment, and the provider\'s pricing structure.\xa0  \n   \n There are scenarios where there can be up to a 20 x price variance between different models for the same use case. This is critical for business to consider alongside performance to ensure the solution is viable and allows for business value to be generated.\xa0\n\n**Conclusion**  \n   \n Benchmarking LLMs is a complex yet essential process that goes beyond mere performance evaluation. It encompasses a comprehensive assessment of quantitative and qualitative metrics, robustness, and ethical considerations such as bias and fairness.\xa0  \n   \n As LLMs continue to evolve and become integral to various applications, it is imperative for organizations to adopt a rigorous benchmarking framework. This framework ensures that the models not only perform optimally but also operate within ethical and secure boundaries, ultimately leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.\n\n# Contact Us\n\n---\n\nTo find out more about working with Capco and how we can help you overcome any potential challenges, contact our experts via the form below.\n\n© Capco 2025, A [Wipro](https://www.wipro.com "Wipro") Company\n\n ')]), SearchResults(query=Query(query='standard datasets for benchmarking LLMs importance in model performance assessment'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/the-current-state-of-benchmarking-llms', title='An Introduction to LLM Benchmarking - Confident AI', raw_content='[Confident AI](/)\n\nProducts\n\n[LLM Evaluation\n\nBenchmark LLM systems to optimize on prompts, models, and catch regressions with metrics powered by DeepEval.](/products/llm-evaluation)[LLM Observability\n\nMonitor, Trace, A/B Test, and get real-time production performance insights with best-in-class LLM Evaluations.](/products/llm-observability)\n\n[Blog](/blog)[Docs](/docs)[Pricing](/pricing)[Careers](/careers)\n\n[10k+](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)[Sign Up Now](https://app.confident-ai.com/auth/signup)\n\nIn this story \n\n* [Scenario, Task, Benchmark Dataset, and Metric](#scenario-task-benchmark-dataset-and-metric)\n\n+ [Scenario](#scenario)\n+ [Task](#task)\n+ [Metric](#metric)\n+ [Benchmark Dataset](#benchmark-dataset)\n\n* [Current Research Frameworks for Benchmarking LLMs](#current-research-frameworks-for-benchmarking-llms)\n\n+ [Language Model Evaluation Harness (by EleutherAI)](#language-model-evaluation-harness-by-eleutherai)\n+ [Stanford HELM](#stanford-helm)\n+ [PromptBench (by Microsoft)](#promptbench-by-microsoft)\n+ [ChatArena (by LMSys)](#chatarena-by-lmsys)\n\n* [Still, Problems with Benchmarking LLMs Remain](#still-problems-with-benchmarking-llms-remain)\n* [Best Practices in Benchmarking LLMs](#best-practices-in-benchmarking-llms)\n\n+ [Pre-Production Evaluation](#pre-production-evaluation)\n+ [Post-Production Evaluation](#post-production-evaluation)\n\n* [Implementing Best Practices for LLM Benchmarking](#implementing-best-practices-for-llm-benchmarking)\n* [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n* [References](#references)\n\nJeffrey Ip\n\nCofounder @ Confident AI, creator of DeepEval & DeepTeam.

Among them are the giants: Mistral 7 billion, Mixtral 8x7 billion, Llama 70 billion, and the colossal Falcon 180 billion. Yet, there also exist models like Phi1, Phi1.5, and Falcon 1B, striving for similar prowess with a leaner framework of 1 to 4 billion parameters. Each model, big or small, shares a common goal: to master the art of language, excelling in tasks like summarization, question-answering, and named entity recognition.\n\nBut across all of these cases, Large Language Models (LLMs) universally share some very flawed behaviors:\n\n* Some prompts cause LLMs to produce gibberish outputs, known as \'jailbreaking prompts\'.\n* LLMs are not always factually correct, a phenomenon also known as \'hallucination\'.\n* LLMs can exhibit unexpected behaviors that are unsafe for consumers to utilize.\n\nIt is evident that merely training LLMs is not sufficient. Thus, the question arises: How can we confidently assert that LLM \'A\' (with \'n\' number of parameters) is superior to LLM \'B\' (with \'m\' parameters)? Or is LLM \'A\' more reliable than LLM \'B\' based on quantifiable, reasonable observations?\n\nThere needs a standard to benchmark LLMs, ensuring they are ethically reliable and factually performant. Although a lot of research has been done on benchmarking (eg. [MMLU, HellaSwag, BBH, etc.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-mmlu-hellaswag-and-beyond)), merely researching is also not enough for robust, customized benchmarking for production use cases.\n\nThis article provides a bird\'s-eye view of current research on LLM evaluation, along with some outstanding open-source implementations in this area. In this blog you will learn:\n\n* Scenarios, Tasks, Benchmark Dataset, and [LLM Evaluation Metrics](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation)\n* Current research on benchmarking LLM and the current problems with them\n* Best practices for LLM Benchmarking/Evaluation\n* Using DeepEval to enforce evaluation best practices\n\n## **Scenario, Task, Benchmark Dataset, and Metric**\n\n“Scenario”, “Task”, “Benchmark Dataset” and “Metric” are some frequently used terms in the evaluation space, so it is extremely important to understand what they mean before proceeding.\n\n#### **Scenario**\n\nA scenario is a broad set of contexts/settings or a condition under which LLM’s performance is assessed or tested. For example:\n\n* Question Answering\n* Reasoning\n* Machine Translation\n* Text Generation and Natural Language Processing.\n\nSeveral popular benchmarks already exist in the field of LLMs, including [MMLU, HellaSwag, and BIG-Bench Hard for example.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-mmlu-hellaswag-and-beyond)\n\n#### **Task**\n\nAs simple as it sounds, a task can be thought of as a more granular form of a scenario. It is more specific on what basis the LLM is evaluated. A task can be a composition (or a group) of a lot of sub-tasks.\n\nFor example, Arithmetic can be considered as a task. Where it clearly mentions it evaluates LLMs on arithmetic questions. Under this, there can be a lot of sub-tasks like Arithmetic Level 1, Level 2, etc. In this example, all the arithmetic sub-tasks (from level 1 to 5) make up the Arithmetic task.\n\nSimilarly, we can have Multiple Choice as a task. Under this, we can have Multiple choice on history, algebra, etc., as all the subtasks. In fact, [MMLU is based entirely on multiple choices.](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-benchmarks-mmlu-hellaswag-and-beyond#mmlu-massive-multitask-language-understanding-)\n\n#### **Metric**\n\nA metric can be defined as a qualitative measure used to evaluate the performance of a Language Model on certain tasks/scenarios. A metric can be either a simple:\n\n* Deterministic statistical/mathematical function (eg., Accuracy)\n* Or a score produced by a Neural Network or an ML model. (eg., BERT Score)\n* Or score generated by the help of [LLMs itself. (eg., G-Eval)](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation)\n\nIn fact, you should read this full article if you want to learn [everything about LLM evaluation metrics](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation). For now, here is a brief overview:\n\nThe above figures try to simplify the taxonomy of the classification of different types of metrics used in LLM evaluation. A metric can also be a composition of different atomic/granular metrics. A very simple example is the F1-score which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n\nSimilarly in NLP, the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a composition of precision, brevity penalty, and N-gram matching. If you wish, you can also club different metrics to come up with a new metric.\n\n#### **Benchmark Dataset**\n\nA benchmark dataset is a standardized collection of test sets that is used to evaluate LLMs on a given task or scenario. Here are some examples:\n\n* [SQuAD for question-answering](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad)\n* [GLUE for natural language understanding and Q&A](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue)\n* [IMDB for sentiment analysis](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb)\n\nIn most of the cases presented in later sections, you will see that a scenario can often consist of a lot of benchmark datasets. A task might consist of a lot of sub-tasks and each sub-task can consist of a bunch of datasets. But, it can also simply be a task that contain some benchmark dataset under it.\n\n## **Current Research Frameworks for Benchmarking LLMs**\n\nIn this section we are going to look into various benchmarking frameworks, and what they offer. Please note: right now there is no standardization in naming conventions. It might sound very confusing when understanding this for the first time, so bear with me.\n\n#### **Language Model Evaluation Harness (by EleutherAI)**\n\n[Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) provides a unified framework to benchmark LLMs on a large number of evaluation **tasks**. I intentionally highlighted the word task, because, there is **NO** such concept of scenarios in Harness (I will use Harness instead of LM Evaluation Harness).\n\nUnder Harness, we can see many tasks, which contains different **subtasks**. Each task or set of subtasks, evaluates an LLM on different areas, like generative capabilities, reasoning in various areas, etc.\n\nEach subtask under a task (or even sometimes the task itself) has a benchmark dataset and the tasks are generally associated with some prominent research done on evaluation. Harness puts a great effort into unifying and structuring all those datasets, configs, and evaluation strategies (like the metrics associated with evaluating the benchmark datasets), all in one place.\n\nNot only that, Harness also supports different kinds of LLM backends (for example: VLLM, GGUF, etc). It enables huge customizability on changing prompts and experimenting with them.\n\nThis is a small example of how you can easily evaluate the [Mistral model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) on the [HellaSwag task](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rowan/hellaswag) (a task to judge the common sense capability of an LLM).\n\n```\n--model \\ --model_args pretrained = \\ --tasks \\ --device \\ --batch_size 8\n```\n\nInspired by LM Evaluation Harness, there is another framework called [BigCode Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-evaluation-harness) by the BigCode project that tries to provide similar API and CLI methods to evaluate LLMs specifically for code generation tasks. Since evaluation for code generation is a very specific topic, we can discuss that in the next blog, so stay tuned!\n\n## Confident AI: The DeepEval LLM Evaluation Platform\n\nThe leading platform to evaluate and test LLM applications on the cloud, native to DeepEval.\n\nRegression test and evaluate LLM apps.\n\nEasily A|B test prompts and models.\n\nEdit and manage datasets on the cloud.\n\nLLM observability with online evals.\n\nPublicly sharable testing reports.\n\nAutomated human feedback collection.\n\n[Try Now for Free](https://app.confident-ai.com/auth/signup)[Checkout DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)\n\n#### Stanford HELM\n\n[HELM](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm) or Holistic Evaluation of Language Model uses **“scenarios”** to outline where the LMs can be applied and **“metrics”** to specify what we want the LLMs to do in a benchmarking setting. A scenario consists of:\n\n* A task (that aligns with the scenario)\n* a domain (which consists of what genre th\n\n  e text is who wrote it and when it was written)\n* The language (i.e. in which language the task is)\n\nHELM then tries to prioritize a subset of scenarios and metrics based on societal relevance (e.g. scenarios considering reliability on user-facing applications), coverage (multi-lingually), and feasibility (i.e. evaluation where a computed optimal significant subset of the task is chosen, instead of running all the datapoints one by one.)\n\nNot only that, this HELM tries to cover a set of 7 metrics (Accuracy, Calibration, Robustness, Fairness, Bias, Toxicity, and Efficiency) for almost all the scenarios, because mere accuracy cannot provide the utmost reliability on LLM performance.\n\n#### PromptBench (by Microsoft)\n\n[PromptBench](https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench?tab=readme-ov-file) is another unified library for benchmarking LLMs. Very similar to HELM and Harness, it supports different LLM frameworks (for example: Hugging Face, VLLM, etc). What sets it apart from other frameworks is that other than just evaluating tasks, it also supports evaluating different Prompt Engineering methods and evaluates LLMs on different prompt-level adversarial attacks. We can also construct pipelines of different evaluations that make production-level use cases easier.\n\n#### ChatArena (by LMSys)\n\nUnlike previous benchmarking frameworks, this framework tries to approach the benchmarking problem differently. This benchmark platform features anonymous, randomized battles of different LLMs on specific prompts and user votes which LLM (keeping it anonymous) did the job better.\n\nAs you can see in the image above, you can start with your prompt and two anonymous LLMs (Model A and B). Both the models give some answer then you choose which model did better. Super simple and intuitive, nothing fancy. However, it does an awesome job of quantifying LLM performance. The quantification of comparison is done through Maximum Likelihood Estimation Elo (MLE-Elo) ratings (a.k.a [Bradley-Terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model) model).\n\nLmSys also provides a leaderboard where different major LLMs are ranked based on the MLE-Elo ratings. You can check that out [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard).\n\n## Still, Problems with Benchmarking LLMs Remain\n\nUp until now, we dived into some awesome research and their various implementations. We learnt:\n\n* How frameworks (like Harness, and HELM) came up with different taxonomies to structure the evaluation tasks.\n* How different open-source platforms like Chatbot Arena makes it simple to benchmark LLMs.\n* How implementations like PromptBench is more focused on production scenarios (like prompt injection attacks or adversarial attacks).\n\nHowever, These systems are consisted of lots of different moving components, like vector databases, orchestration of different LLM workloads (a.k.a agents), prompt engineering, data for fine-tuning, etc., is a pain to manage.\n\nAnother problem we have is the distinction in research and production evaluation. Building and fine-tuning LLMs rapidly and shipping to production is not an easy task, and ignoring the cost and inference optimization, production-grade evaluation infrastructure is another important bottleneck. Let me explain in more detail.\n\nAs we all can agree on, testing is an important part and parcel of classical rapid software development (eg., in Python, PyTest plays an important role in testing), and is also used in CI/CD pipelines before shipping newer updates to software, and hence development process becomes streamlined and reliable.\n\nHowever, we do not have a Pytest-like testing infrastructure for LLMs. Even if we have something like that, LLMs are probabilistic machines, which makes defining deterministic test cases inadequate. A thorough testing in real-time and stress testing (red teaming) is also important. But, that kind of thing is also not present right now at scale, which hinders the process of building production-grade Gen AI products.\n\nSince LLMs need to be continuously fine-tuned, which are later used to develop LLM systems (for example RAG based systems), you need infrastructure that:\n\n* Simultaneous evaluation during fine-tuning\n* Evaluation test cases for pre/post-production\n* Red teaming / Stress testing and A/B testing of LLMs and LLM systems at scale.\n* Evaluation and corrections of data that will be used for LLMs.\n\nNow at this point, if you are thinking that harness or HELM can be very useful, then you are right and wrong at the same time. Although HELM and Harness are providing users a huge leap towards evaluating LLMs, all of these libraries have shadow interfaces (API interfaces that are not mentioned properly in the documentation) and mostly use or run through CLI, which is not ideal for the rapid prototyping of models.\n\nLastly, we might require very domain-specific evaluations that is out-of-scope of these current benchmarking frameworks. Writing those evaluations should be as easy as writing test cases for PyTest, and the same goes for benchmarking LLMs, which these frameworks do not currently support.\n\n## Best Practices in Benchmarking LLMs\n\nAlthough this whole field is very much new, we are seeing and emerging trend that practitioners are mostly using LLMs for very specific use cases such as text summarization, QA on internal knowledge bases, and data extraction. In most cases, LLMs need to be benchmarked on how faithful they are, and also they need to be benchmarked on how accurate they are in the domain on which they will be deployed.\n\nSo, a typical development lifecycle:\n\n* Starts with an existing open-source LLM or a closed-source LLM.\n* Adapts your LLM to the desired use case. We can do this by either doing some prompt engineering (like Chain of Thoughts or using In-Context Learning), or using vector databases in RAG to provide more contexts. We can fine-tune the LLM and use the previous methods along with it to get the full performance out of the LLM.\n* Put into production with additional [guardrailing](https://attri.ai/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-everything-you-need-to-know-about-llms-guardrails#:~:text=Guardrails%20for%20Language%20Learning%20Models,of%20these%20advanced%20AI%20systems.) of LLMs, and connecting it with the backend server to get the data as their input.\n\nThe above set of processes can be divided into two phases.\n\n1. Pre-production evaluation.\n2. Post-production evaluation.\n\n#### Pre-Production Evaluation\n\nDuring this initial exploration phase, we can experiment with each of the following combinations:\n\n* LLM + prompt engineering (like CoT or In-Context Learning).\n* LLM + prompt engineering + RAG.\n* Fine-tuning LLM + prompt engineering + RAG, etc works the best.\n\nSince working with LLMs is a costly business, we need to keep a perfect balance between cost and quality. So experimentation is a huge part of this process. We also need to have proper evaluation infrastructure that:\n\n* can evaluate the LLMs on different prompts and have a place where we can rank which prompt combinations work the best.\n* can evaluate the retrieval engines (which consist of retrieval models) in RAG-based use cases to understand how factually correct contexts are retrieved before feeding to the LLM.\n* can evaluate different fine-tuning checkpoints (that are made during fine-tuning of the LLMs) and evaluate which checkpoints work the best.\n* can have some standardized scores from HELM or Harness (i.e. from their standardized benchmark dataset that falls under the target domain). This is important so that we can have an evaluation scorecard (very similar to model cards or dataset cards), which is universal and becoming standardized.\n* can evaluate a custom domain-specific private benchmark dataset so that we can be fully sure of how the LLM is performing on data that will be similar during production.\n* can evaluate how reliable the LLMs are (i.e. the LLMs should not be toxic or unfaithful or should not be able to prompt high jacked, etc.) and how accurate it is (i.e. how factually correct the LLM is).\n* can evaluate different pipelines (as mentioned in the above combinations) to understand which pipeline combination works the best.\n* last but not least rigorous\n\n  [red-teaming](https://huggingface.co/blog/red-teaming)\n\n  of the LLMs is very much required (specifically for chat-based models) before putting it into production.\n\n#### Post-Production Evaluation\n\nOnce LLMs are deployed, here are some very important best practices that can be employed after putting LLM pipelines into production:\n\n1. Continuous monitoring of LLMs. This is very important so that we can maintain near-realtime-altering systems for unsatisfactory outputs of LLM apps. This also helps to understand what went wrong easily and fix it.\n2. Explicit feedback such as indicators (eg., user thumbs up/down rating) to give feedback to the LLM generation.\n3. Supporting continuous fine-tuning of the LLM (along with the embedding models used in RAG-based applications) and continuous deployment to maintain customer-centric generations, otherwise the application might face eventual data drifts.\n\n## Implementing Best Practices for LLM Benchmarking\n\nIf you want to practice building a testing framework for LLMs, implementing everything from scratch is a great choice. However, if you want to use an existing robust evaluation framework for LLMs, use [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval), as we\'ve done all the hard work for you already.\n\nDeepEval is the open-source evaluation infrastructure for LLMs, and makes following best practices for evaluation processes as easy as writing test cases in PyTest. Here are the things it offers to solve current problems with benchmarking LLMs:\n\n* Integrated with PyTest, so it provides you with a very similar interface and decorators in Pytest so that you can write domain-specific test cases for evaluating LLMs for use cases that current benchmarking frameworks don\'t cover.\n* Offers 14+ pre-defined metrics to evaluate LLMs/RAG-based systems, that runs both locally on your machine or using GPT models. Users are also free to write their own customized evaluation metrics, which are all automatically integrated with DeepEval\'s evaluation ecosystem.\n* Push evaluation results to Confident AI, DeepEval\'s hosted platform, that allows you to keep track of evaluation experiments, debug evaluation results, centralize benchmarking datasets for evaluation, and track production events to continuously evaluate LLMs via different reference-less metrics.\n\nNot only that, but several new features like integration of LM-Evaluation Harness, and concurrent evaluations during fine-tuning using HuggingFace are coming soon.

We also learned about some prominent research on evaluating benchmarking and comparing LLMs on various tasks or scenarios. Finally, we discussed the current problems of evaluating LLMs during a production use case and also went through some best practices that can help us overcome the commonly seen production-related issues and deploy LLMs safely and confidently.\n\n## References\n\n* [LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness)\n* [Language Models are Changing AI: The Need for Holistic Evaluation](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2022/11/17/helm.html)\n* [Lightning Talks on LLM Evaluation: By Anindyadeep](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10nkbnoLf8KiY9yZeYhyT3aoR6soZv6NmB0d-6DR9Yr4/edit#slide=id.g29803c2272f_0_0)\n* [Code Generation Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-evaluation-harness)\n* [Everything you need to know about LLM Guadrails.](https://attri.ai/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-everything-you-need-to-know-about-llms-guardrails#:~:text=Guardrails%20for%20Language%20Learning%20Models,of%20these%20advanced%20AI%20systems.)\n* [Best practices for deploying LLMs by Open AI.](https://openai.com/blog/best-practices-for-deploying-language-models)\n\n---\n\nDo you want to brainstorm how to evaluate your LLM (application)?

LLM evaluation goes beyond simply checking whether the model generates grammatically correct sentences. It helps us measure a model’s performance on a specific task, ensure the safety and trustworthiness of the model outputs, and compare different models.\n\nTo evaluate LLMs, we use different methods, metrics, and benchmarks. It is important to choose the right metric and benchmark for evaluating LLM outputs during evaluation. For example, we cannot use the same metric to evaluate two different LLMs trained for summarization and paraphrasing tasks. Each task requires separate tests to understand how the model will perform in a real-world scenario.\n\nWe need to understand the different evaluation methodologies, metrics, and benchmarks to evaluate LLMs efficiently. Let’s start with the methodologies.\n\n## LLM evaluation methodologies\n\nEffective LLM evaluation frameworks use different methodologies depending on the task and available resources. The primary LLM evaluation approaches include metric-based evaluation, human-based assessment, LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, and benchmark-based evaluation, each offering unique advantages for measuring model performance.\n\n### Metric-based evaluation\n\nMetric-based evaluation methods consist of automated tests to evaluate LLM outputs. In these methods, we use different computational metrics to score model outputs against references.\n\n* We use lexical overlap metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR for tasks like translation and summarization.\n* We use semantic similarity metrics like BERTScore and MoverScore for tasks like paraphrasing and summarization.\n\nMetric-based evaluation is a quick and objective method to evaluate LLMs. However, it doesn’t capture how the LLMs perform in tasks that require reasoning, common sense, and natural language inference. To evaluate LLMs for these aspects, we use benchmarks.\n\n### Benchmark-based evaluation\n\nBenchmarks are a set of tasks that we use to evaluate LLMs for different aspects, such as natural language understanding, reasoning, reading comprehension, truthfulness, etc. Benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, SQuAD, and ARC help us evaluate LLMs for tasks that cannot be evaluated using metric-based methods.\n\nBenchmarks perform better in evaluating LLMs. However, they don’t capture whether the LLM output is fluent, factual, and free from bias. We use human evaluation to evaluate LLM outputs for coherence, fluency, factuality, and bias.\n\n### Human evaluation\n\nIn human evaluation, human judges are directly employed to rate LLM outputs based on different parameters. To evaluate the LLM output, the human judges use various parameters and rate the model output from 1 to 5 or 0 to 1. The average score of all the human judges is considered the LLM’s score for a particular parameter. Some of the popular parameters we use to evaluate LLMs using human judges are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Aspect |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Fluency** | Is the LLM output natural and grammatically correct? |\n| **Coherence** | Do sentences in the output connect logically? |\n| **Factuality** | Is the information in the output factually correct? |\n| **Helpfulness** | Does the output answer the question fully? |\n| **Safety & Bias** | Does the LLM avoid harmful content? |\n\nHuman evaluation evaluates LLM outputs for aspects that are difficult to measure using automated metrics and benchmarks. It is important to include humans in the LLM evaluation process. However, human evaluation is slow and costly. Hence, we should combine automatic metrics, human ratings, and benchmark scores for a robust LLM evaluation process.\n\n### LLM-as-a-judge evaluation\n\nInstead of relying on humans, we can use LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini to evaluate outputs from other LLMs. ChatGPT and Gemini are trained on web-scale datasets and possess reasoning capabilities as they are trained using techniques like [chain-of-thought prompting](https://www.codecademy.com/article/chain-of-thought-cot-prompting). Hence, we can use them as judges to evaluate other LLMs by providing them with context and reference texts. This will allow us to evaluate thousands of LLM outputs quickly without needing large human annotation teams while still delivering reasonably reliable assessments.\n\nHaving a brief idea of the evaluation methodologies, let’s discuss the different LLM evaluation metrics and benchmarks.\n\n## LLM evaluation metrics\n\nLLM evaluation metrics evaluate an LLM’s output based on a specified criterion. These metrics help us quantify the different properties of LLM’s output, such as correctness, hallucination, semantic relevance, etc.\n\n### BLEU\n\nBilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) is a metric we use to evaluate the quality of a text generated by a machine. To assess an LLM’s response using BLEU, we need reference outputs for every input given to the LLM. *BLEU measures how similar the LLM-generated output is to the reference text.* For this, it creates sequences of words of length n (n-grams) from the output text and checks how many of the generated n-grams appear in the reference text.\n\nBLEU scores range from 0 to 1, where 1 suggests a perfect match of the LLM output with the reference and 0 represents no overlap. BLEU focuses on precision and evaluates how much of the LLM output is correct compared to the reference. We can use BLEU to evaluate LLM outputs in summarization, translation, and question-answering tasks.\n\n### ROUGE\n\nRecall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) consists of metrics for evaluating LLM’s outputs using reference texts. *ROUGE measures how much of the content from the reference text is present in the LLM output.* We calculate the ROUGE score by dividing the number of common words, phrases, or n-grams between the reference and output text by the total words, phrases, or n-grams in the reference text.\n\nROUGE scores also range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a good output. ROUGE is recall-oriented and measures how much of the reference content is present in the LLM output. ROUGE is widely used to evaluate LLMs for text summarization tasks.\n\n### METEOR\n\nMetric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ordering (METEOR) improves on BLEU and ROUGE to evaluate the quality of LLM output using reference texts. Like BLEU or ROUGE, METEOR measures exact matches of words and phrases. However, it also measures words with the same root (stemming matches) and words with similar meaning (synonym matches).\n\nWe use the following steps while evaluating the LLM output with METEOR:\n\n* We first calculate the precision, i.e., the ratio of the number of common words between the LLM output and the reference text to the total number of words in the LLM output.\n* Next, we calculate recall, i.e., the ratio of the number of common words between the LLM output and the reference text to the total number of words in the reference text.\n* After calculating precision and recall, we calculate the F1 Score, i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n* Finally, we add a penalty to the F1 Score based on the difference in the order of the words in the LLM output and the reference text to get the final METEOR score.\n\nUnlike BLEU and ROUGE, METEOR understands synonyms and word variations in the LLM output and better aligns with human judgment. However, these metrics depend on word overlap and statistical analysis of the text, not semantic meaning. We can use vector embeddings of the reference text and the LLM output to measure semantic similarity between them. For this, we can use BERTScore.\n\n### BERTScore\n\nWe use BERTScore to measure the semantic similarity between the reference text and LLM output while evaluating LLMs. To use BERTScore, we first tokenize the reference text and the LLM output and generate their embeddings using models like BERT or RoBERTa. Then, we compute the similarity between each candidate word embedding and each reference word embedding using cosine similarity. For each token in the LLM output, we find the most similar token in the reference text using precision and recall.\n\n* Precision determines how well the words in the LLM output are covered by reference words *in meaning*. To calculate precision, we find the most similar token in the reference text for each token in the LLM output. Then, we take the average of the maximum similarity scores for all the tokens in the LLM output.\n* Recall determines how well the reference words are covered by the words in the LLM output *in meaning*. To calculate recall, we find the most similar token in the LLM output for each token in the reference text. Then, we take the average of the maximum similarity scores for all the tokens in the reference text.\n\nAfter calculating precision and recall, we calculate the F1 Score by taking their harmonic mean, which is termed the BERTScore.\n\n### MoverScore\n\nMoverScore evaluates LLM outputs against a reference text using the text embeddings. In this technique, we first create vector embeddings for the LLM output and the reference text. Then, we use the earth mover distance to calculate the dissimilarity between the LLM output and the reference text. The more the distance, the more the LLM output is semantically different from the reference text.\n\n### Factuality\n\nFactuality measures how well an LLM output aligns with facts. LLM applications can hallucinate and produce incorrect outputs. Hence, evaluating the LLM output’s truthfulness is important using human evaluation and automated metrics.\n\n* In human evaluation, we check whether each statement in the LLM output is factually correct with respect to a reference document. However, this is costly and time-consuming.\n* We can use natural language inference (NLI) models to check if a given text in the LLM output is entailed or supported by the reference text.\n* We can also create question-answer pairs from the LLM output and use the reference text to answer the questions. If the answers match, we can establish the factuality of the LLM output.\n\nYou can use models like [FactCC](https://huggingface.co/manueldeprada/FactCC),[SummaC](https://github.com/tingofurro/summac), and [QAGS](https://github.com/W4ngatang/qags) to measure the factuality of a summary with reference to a reference text.\n\n## LLM evaluation benchmarks\n\nLLM evaluation benchmarks are a set of tasks and datasets for evaluating LLMs. Let’s start with GLUE and discuss different benchmarks, such as SUPERGLUE, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, SQuAD, and ARC.\n\n### GLUE\n\nWe use the [General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmark to evaluate how well an LLM understands natural language. GLUE consists of [nine datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue) and tasks that cover different aspects of natural language. All the tasks are divided into three categories, i.e., single-sentence tasks, similarity and paraphrase tasks, and inference tasks.\n\n#### Single-sentence tasks\n\n[Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)](https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/) and [Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/sst2) are single-sentence tasks in GLUE.\n\n* CoLA is used to decide if a sentence in LLM output is grammatically acceptable. The [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shivkumarganesh/CoLA) contains a sequence of words and a label showing whether the sentence is grammatically correct.\n* The SST-2 dataset contains sentences extracted from movie reviews and their sentiment labels, which we can use to evaluate LLMs for sentiment analysis tasks.\n\n#### Similarity and paraphrase tasks\n\nGLUE has [Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)](https://github.com/magsail/MRPC), [Quora Question Pairs (QQP)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-question-pairs/), and [Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/stsb) datasets to evaluate LLMs for similarity and paraphrase tasks.\n\n* The [MRPC dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/mrpc) contains sentence pairs and a label to denote whether they are semantically equivalent.\n* The [QQP dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/qqp) contains question pairs from Quora, with a label showing if the questions are duplicates.\n* The STS-B dataset contains sentence pairs with human-annotated similarity scores between 0 and 1, which indicate whether the sentences have the same meaning.\n\nWe can use MRPC, STS-B, and QQP to evaluate LLMs for paraphrasing and semantic understanding tasks.\n\n#### Natural language inference tasks\n\nFor natural language inference, GLUE provides [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/mnli), [Question Answering Natural Language Inference (QNLI)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/qnli), [Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/rte), and [Winograd Schema Challenge(WNLI)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue/viewer/wnli) datasets.\n\n* The MNLI dataset contains premise and hypothesis sentence pairs with a classification label showing entailment, neutrality, or contradiction between the premise and hypothesis.\n* RTE contains premise and hypothesis sentence pairs with a classification label showing entailment or no entailment between the premise and hypothesis.\n* WNLI is similar to RTE. However, it contains a complex reading comprehension task in which the LLM needs to figure out what a pronoun refers to to decide whether the premise and hypthesis show entailment or no entailment.\n* The QNLI dataset contains question-paragraph pairs with a label showing whether or not one of the sentences in the paragraph contains the answer to the question.\n\nGLUE provides a robust mechanism for evaluating LLM outputs using all these datasets and tasks. Each task checks a different skill in language understanding, and an LLM’s overall score tells us how good the model really is.\n\nWith continuous improvement, models like BERT and RoBERTa efficiently solved tasks in the GLUE framework. Hence, SuperGLUE was introduced to test LLMs for deeper reasoning, commonsense, and more challenging NLP tasks that GLUE couldn’t assess.\n\n### SuperGLUE\n\nThe [Super General Language Understanding Evaluation (SuperGLUE)](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) benchmark contains eight tasks that evaluate LLMs on different parameters.\n\n* The [Boolean Questions (BoolQ)](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/boolean-questions) dataset contains a paragraph, a question, and a boolean (Yes/No) answer to the question that tests the LLM for reading comprehension and factual reasoning.\n* The [CommitmentBank (CB)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/cb) dataset contains premise and hypothesis sentence pairs and a label showing entailment, neutrality, or contradiction.\n* [Choice of Plausible Alternatives(COPA)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/copa) contains a premise and two choices where one of the choices is the cause or effect of the premise. It tests the LLM’s causal reasoning abilities.\n* [Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension (MultiRC)](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/multirc/) contains multi-sentence paragraphs, a question, and some answer options where one or more answers can be correct. The LLM has to predict the correct and incorrect answers. [MultiRC](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/multirc) checks for LLM’s deep comprehension abilities between multiple sentences.\n* [Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning (ReCoRD)](https://sheng-z.github.io/ReCoRD-explorer/) consists of passages from news articles along with a query with a missing entity. The LLM needs to find the missing entity in the query by analyzing the passage in the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/record).\n* The [Word-in-Context(WiC)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/wic) dataset contains two sentences with a common word, and the LLM has to identify if the given word has the same meaning in both the sentences.\n* The [WSC (Winograd Schema Challenge)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue/viewer/wsc) dataset contains a sentence, an entity from the sentence, a pronoun, and a label showing if the pronoun refers to the given entity. The WNLI dataset used in GLUE is a reformulated version of WSC.\n* The RTE dataset, which is also known as [Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/), is the same as that used in the GLUE benchmark.\n\nSuperGLUE is better than GLUE for evaluating LLMs for comprehension, reasoning, commonsense, and multi-sentence understanding tasks, and it remains the gold standard for evaluating LLMs.\n\n### HellaSwag\n\nThe [HellaSwag](https://github.com/rowanz/hellaswag) benchmark was built to evaluate the commonsense reasoning abilities of LLMs. The [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rowan/hellaswag) contains a sentence, a list of possible endings, and the label denoting the actual ending. HellaSwag checks if an LLM can choose the most sensible continuation of the sentence beyond grammar or word overlap.\n\n### TruthfulQA\n\n[TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) is a benchmark for evaluating if LLMs give factually correct answers or mirror common misconceptions, false beliefs, or biased statements. The TruthfulQA [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/domenicrosati/TruthfulQA) contains a question, the best answer for the question, a list of correct answers, and a list of incorrect answers. Using the questions and the LLM output, we can evaluate the truthfulness and factuality of the answers given by the LLM.\n\n### SQuAD\n\n[Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is the benchmark to evaluate LLMs for machine reading comprehension. The [SQuAD dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkar/squad) contains a paragraph, a question for which the answer is present in the given paragraph, and the answer to the question. The LLM needs to answer the question based on the information provided in the paragraph. The QNLI dataset used in the GLUE benchmark is also derived from SQuAD.\n\n### ARC\n\nAI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) is a multiple-choice question-answering benchmark. The [ARC dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc) contains questions, multiple choices for the answer, and an answer key containing the correct answer. It tests whether LLMs can apply reasoning and scientific knowledge instead of memorization and word matching.\n\nAs we have discussed different metrics and benchmarks to evaluate LLMs, let’s discuss the advantages of evaluating large language models.\n\n## Advantages of LLM evaluation\n\nEvaluating LLMs using different metrics and benchmarks helps us understand how they perform in different tasks. The following are some of the advantages of LLM evaluation.\n\n* **Measuring model quality**: LLM evaluation helps us check whether the LLM can produce accurate and relevant outputs for a given use case. Without evaluation, we might be unable to decide whether a given model is suitable for a particular task.\n* **Fair comparison between LLMs**: Benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE give us a standardized setup for evaluating LLMs. We can use the performance of LLMs on these benchmarks to decide if one is better than another for the given set of tasks.\n* **Identifying an LLM’s strengths and weaknesses**: An LLM might be good at paraphrasing, but it might not work well for question-answering tasks. LLM evaluation helps us identify an LLM’s strengths and weaknesses so that we can use the model in tasks where it performs best.\n* **Progress in AI research and development**: With insight into an LLM’s weaknesses, we can develop new models to overcome the shortcomings. Similarly, if an LLM becomes excellent at a given benchmark, we can build more complex tasks and benchmarks to evaluate LLMs and drive progress.\n* **Reliability and safety**: Different benchmarks give us an insight into an LLM’s reasoning and comprehension abilities. With benchmarks like TruthfulQA, we can assess if an LLM can generate outputs free from bias or misconceptions. Hence, LLM evaluation helps ensure reliability and safety in LLM applications.\n\nWhile LLM evaluation has many benefits, it also has several challenges. Let’s discuss some of these challenges.\n\n## Challenges in LLM evaluation\n\nWe face several technical and procedural challenges while evaluating LLMs. The following are some of the challenges in evaluating large language models.\n\n* **Benchmark saturation**: LLMs have become very good at solving tasks in earlier benchmarks like GLUE and SQuAD and often outperform humans. However, it doesn’t mean that they have become truly intelligent. As the benchmark datasets get included in the training dataset of new LLMs, we need to devise new benchmarks that can objectively evaluate LLMs.\n* **Narrow coverage in benchmarks**: Unlike GLUE and SuperGLUE, most benchmarks evaluate models for a specific task or aspect. An LLM can excel at HellaSwag but struggle in TruthfulQA. Hence, it is important to evaluate LLMs for different benchmarks to establish their reliability in real-world applications.\n* **Costly human evaluation**: We need human judges to evaluate LLMs for fluency, coherence, helpfulness, and bias. Human evaluation is expensive, slow, and subjective. There is also an inherent risk of biased human judges, who can rate unsafe or biased outputs as safe. Hence, it is essential to standardize the human evaluation process.\n* **Lack of real-world alignment**: Benchmarks and evaluation metrics don’t capture how people use LLMs. A model that performs well on benchmarks can still give incorrect or biased outputs in real-world scenarios.\n\nHaving discussed the advantages and challenges of LLM evaluation, let’s discuss some of the best practices for evaluating LLMs that can help you maximize advantages and overcome the challenges.\n\n## LLM evaluation best practices\n\nLLM evaluation is a complex process, and we must avoid any mistakes that can make the results unfair or misleading. The following are some of the LLM evaluation best practices you can use to evaluate LLMs in a better manner:\n\n* **Use multiple metrics and benchmarks**: An LLM can excel on a benchmark but struggle with another. Therefore, we should evaluate LLMs across different metrics and benchmarks before deciding on the quality of the model.\n* **Use standard datasets and benchmarks**: We shouldn’t rely on ad hoc and less reproducible methods and datasets to evaluate LLMs. Always use established benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, TruthfulQA, SQuAD, HellaSwag, etc, for LLM evaluation.\n* **Check for overfitting**: It is possible that an LLM memorizes the publicly available benchmark dataset or is fine-tuned for a particular benchmark. To avoid misjudgement, we should use out-of-distribution tests and adversarial examples. For example, you can paraphrase the question in the SQuaD or QNLI dataset to check if an LLM can comprehend the question or has just memorized the answers from the training dataset.\n* **Combine metric-based and human evaluation**: Human and metric-based evaluations work differently. Automated tests like GLUE or SuperGLUE are fast but lack tests for fluency, helpfulness, safety, and bias. Human evaluation can help assess LLMs on these subjective criteria, even if it’s an expensive and slow method. Hence, we should combine human evaluation and automated evaluation methodologies to better assess the LLMs.\n* **Include bias, fairness, and safety checks**: We should explicitly test the LLMs for harmful content, stereotypes, or unsafe responses. This is important for real-world deployment, as biased and harmful responses can lead to economic and reputation loss for any given organization using the LLM.\n* **Adopt continuous evaluation**: We should continuously evaluate and improve LLMs using user feedback, A/B testing, and [reinforcement learning](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-reinforcement-learning-with-examples) so that the model performs well in real-world situations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs LLMs continue to be adopted in business, education, healthcare, and other domains, rigorous evaluation is required to ensure they remain accurate, safe, and reliable. By systematically assessing an LLM’s accuracy, reasoning, safety, and real-world usefulness, we can ensure that the model serves the intended purpose responsibly.\n\nIn this article, we discussed LLM evaluation methodologies, metrics, and benchmarks. We also discussed the advantages, challenges, and best practices for LLM evaluation.

Is a higher BLEU score better?\n\nYes, a higher BLEU score is better as it indicates that the LLM output is more similar to the reference text, which is good.\n\n### 2. What are the most important benchmarks for LLM evaluation?\n\nLLM evaluation benchmarks are standardized tasks and datasets to test LLMs for causal reasoning, natural language inference, and real-world usefulness. The most important LLM evaluation benchmarks within modern evaluation frameworks include GLUE and SuperGLUE for language understanding, HellaSwag for commonsense reasoning, TruthfulQA for factual accuracy, and MMLU for multitask performance.\n\n### 3. What is golden dataset for LLM evaluation?\n\nA golden dataset for LLM evaluation is a curated and labeled dataset we use as ground truth to evaluate the performance of large language models. Presently, SuperGLUE is the gold standard benchmark for LLM evaluation, containing eight datasets for different tasks, such as reading comprehension, factual reasoning, and natural language inference.\n\n### 4. What is the difference between LLM model evaluation and system evaluation?\n\nLLM model evaluation only tests the LLM’s comprehension, reasoning, and inference capabilities. LLM system evaluation includes integrating testing, load testing, security testing, and usability testing to test the entire LLM application for latency, scalability, security, and user-friendliness in a real-world setting.\n\n### 5. What is the goal of regression testing in LLM evaluations?\n\nRegression testing checks whether an application’s old features work correctly after new changes. We use regression testing in LLM evaluations to ensure that model updates, prompt updates, or algorithm changes do not impact the LLM’s existing functionalities and performance.\n\nCodecademy Team\n\n'The Codecademy Team, composed of experienced educators and tech experts, is dedicated to making tech skills accessible to all.

However, with this rapid advancement comes the challenge of ensuring that these models perform reliably and ethically across different applications.\xa0  \n   \n Benchmarking LLMs has become a critical step in their use throughout the implementation lifecycle\xa0 , providing a structured way to evaluate model performance, robustness, and fairness. It is not just about testing the LLM on its own, but for the use case and data at hand which has a huge impact on performance and outputs.\xa0  \n   \n In this article we outline a framework for benchmarking LLMs, as well as highlighting the importance of validation at various stages of the life cycle, the value of both quantitative and qualitative metrics, and the need to address vulnerabilities and biases.\n\n# Benchmarking Large Language Models : Enhancing Reliability & Reducing Bias\n\n* Leo Ferrari, Caleb Severn, Srinivas Waghmare, Ghadir Abu Ahmad\n* Published: 09 December 2024\n\n**The LLM market is characterized by a high degree of complexity and rapid innovation. With the availability of numerous models, each boasting distinct capabilities, organizations face significant challenges in selecting the most suitable LLM for their specific use cases.**   \n The opaque nature of the training data used in proprietary models further complicates this process, making it difficult to fully understand their behaviours and potential risks. Additionally, traditional validation methods often fall short against the scale and complexity of modern LLMs, leading to potential issues in scalability and generalization.\xa0  \n   \n The need for a structured and rigorous benchmarking process is increasingly pressing, not only to minimise the risk of deploying suboptimal models but also to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory standards and ethical guidelines, ultimately building trust with stakeholders and driving innovation.\n\n**The Different Stages of LLM Validation**  \n   \n Effective LLM validation is not a one-size-fits-all process but rather a multi-faceted approach that requires careful consideration at each stage.  \n   \n As part of the full mode life cycle, after clearly defining the objectives and metrics that align with the intended use case (a crucial step setting the foundation for all subsequent evaluations) and preparing and cleaning the data, evaluation can be viewed as belonging to the following four major areas.\n\n**Quantitative Evaluation** – Quantitative metrics are employed to evaluate the model\'s performance. These metrics are task-specific and provide objective measures of how well the model is performing. While traditional classification metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1 score are useful for some tasks, LLMs often require more nuanced and task-specific metrics such as Rouge for summarization and text generation  \n   \n **Qualitative Evaluation** – Human evaluation plays a significant role in assessing the quality, coherence, and relevance of the model’s outputs. This stage helps identify areas where the model may perform well on paper but falls short in real-world applications.  \n   \n **Robustness Testing** – The model is tested against various adversarial inputs to assess its stability and security, identifying potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in real-world scenarios, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection.  \n   \n **Bias and Fairness Testing** – Finally, the model\'s outputs are examined for bias and fairness, ensuring that the LLM treats all demographics equitably and adheres to ethical standards. This stage is particularly important in applications where decisions can significantly impact people\'s lives\n\nEach stage of validation is necessary for the overall success of deploying LLMs, ensuring that the models not only perform well but also operate within ethical and secure boundaries. Although each stage demands investment of resource, effort, and expertise, omitting any one of them could lead to gaps that surface in production or can be exploited by malicious parties.\n\n**1. Quantitative metrics**\n\nQuantitative metrics form the starting of LLM evaluation, offering objective measures that help quantify a model’s performance across different tasks. These metrics are tailored to the specific tasks that LLMs are designed to perform, ranging from language modelling and text generation to machine translation and summarization. Industry benchmarks (such as HuggingFace’s LLM Leaderboard) can be useful for determining a shortlist of models and providers from the market that you may want to test for your use case. Figure 1 shows examples of quantitative metrics by task.\n\nFigure 1: Non-exhaustive list of quantitative metrics for LLMs, grouped by task\n\nDepending on your use case, you might consider LLM performance in the following areas:\n\n* **Text generation:** quality, coherence, relevance, and similarity of generated text compared to reference text or desired outputs\n* **Summarisation:** how accurately and comprehensively the generated summary captures key information and content\n* **Translation:** accuracy, fluency, and alignment of the translated text with the meaning and structure of original text\n* **Information retrieval:** relevance, accuracy, and ranking quality of retrieved documents or results in response to a query\n* **Question & answering:** accuracy, relevance, and completeness of the model\'s answers by comparing them to the correct or reference answers\n* **Speech Recognition:** accuracy and clarity of transcribed text by comparing it to the original spoken input\n* **Image captioning:** accuracy, relevance, and descriptiveness of generated captions by comparing them to human-written reference captions\n\nWhile quantitative metrics provide a robust framework for evaluating LLMs, they must be interpreted carefully, especially in the context of the specific use case. Published metrics often highlight strengths that may not fully align with the practical needs of an application, necessitating a more nuanced approach to their application.\n\nFigure 2: BLEU Summarisation Scores of LLMs\xa0 \xa0Llama3 (Meta), Gemma2 (Google), ChatGPT4o (OpenAI), and Luhn Summarisation Algorithm on BCBS 239 documentation, assessed across a range of uni-, bi-, tri- and quad-gram overlap weightings\n\nFor example, if you need an LLM to summarise text on BCBS documentation, you may choose Llama3 as it displays better overlap between the summarised and original text, as seen in Figure 2. However, if you wanted a summarisation that delineated different topics within the original text, ChatGPT-4o\xa0 could be better – something we will examine in a future article.  \n   \n Once you have shortlisted models to build into your pipeline, it is prudent to evaluate them using metrics that are bespoke to your use case and KPIs and tested on your data. For example, evaluating a model\'s suitability for finance and banking involves assessing its pre-training on financial texts, ease of fine-tuning with domain-specific data, and ability to transfer knowledge from general language tasks to finance-specific applications. This ensures the model performs well in the unique context of the financial sector.\n\n**2. Qualitative Metrics**  \n   \n While quantitative metrics provide numerical insights into an LLM’s performance, qualitative metrics capture the nuances that numbers alone cannot. These human-centric evaluations are useful for validating how well an LLM performs in real-world scenarios, where the subtleties of language, context, and user interaction play significant roles.\xa0  \n   \n Human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation approaches can enable continued SME involvement to understand model idiosyncrasies, mitigate risks and improve fidelity in a controlled environment before the model is deployed to production. Due to resource requirements (financial and FTE), this step could easily be omitted during prototyping but should be deeply considered before deployment, and should heavily involve business stakeholders to weigh against budget and timelines.\n\n\xa0 \xa0  \n   \n  Figure 3: Summary of HITL approaches with qualitative assessment of strengths; green denotes a strength of the approach, orange denotes an area to consider when employing the approach\n\n**3. Robustness Tests**  \n   \n As LLMs become more integral to various applications, their vulnerabilities also become more apparent. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by adversarial attacks, involving deliberately crafted inputs designed to trick the model into producing incorrect or harmful outputs. Addressing these vulnerabilities through robust defences is critical to ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs.  \n   \n Combating adversarial attacks can be a hugely laborious task, and it is reasonable that enterprise users of the LLMs expect the heavy lifting to be done by the providers. Nevertheless, providers can only do so much, so it is prudent to consider the defensive strategies that tech teams can incorporate into their processes:\n\n* **Hyperparameter tuning:** adjusting model parameters, such as temperature, can reduce the success of prompt injection attacks.\n* **Audit behaviour:** employ optimisation algorithms to identify elusive and undesirable model behaviours before deployment.\n* **Input/output filtering:** preprocess incoming data to identify and mitigate potential threats and anomalies and/or post-process model’s generated responses by blocking or modifying it to maintain ethical and safe interactions with LLMs.\n* **Human feedback integration:** incorporate human feedback and preferences directly into the pretraining phase rather than the fine-tuning stage to produce outputs that resonate more closely with human generations.\n* **Red teaming and adversarial training:** employ a dedicated group (human and automated techniques) using bespoke datasets simulating adversarial behaviours and attack strategies to identify vulnerability in the system, across hardware, software, and human elements.\n\n**4. Bias & Fairness**  \n   \n Ensuring that LLMs operate fairly across all demographic groups is a core principle of Responsible AI. Bias in the data that LLMs train on can lead to unequal treatment of users, perpetuating stereotypes and potentially causing harm in decision-making processes.\xa0  \n   \n Bias and fairness testing for LLMs focuses on evaluating model outputs across diverse demographic groups and contexts to identify disparities. It involves tasks like language generation, sentiment analysis, and classification, using diverse datasets and specific metrics to assess and ensure fairness and equity in model performance. The tests broadly cover the following approaches:\n\n* **Sentence completion tasks** with prompts that reveal biases in race, gender, religion, and other social categories (StereoSet, CrowS-Pairs, BOLD, WinoBias)\n* **Prediction or implicit association** of occupation or other attributes with social categories (Bias in Bios, WinoGender, SEAT)\n* **Using prompts** to elicit toxic responses (RealToxicityPrompts)\n\nEnsuring fairness in LLMs involves not only using diverse datasets and benchmarks but also continuously monitoring and updating the models to address emerging biases. While these tests primarily serve to diagnose biases, mitigating them is an integrated process where techniques such as prompt engineering can provide guardrails for the LLM when generating responses. However, total protection is not guaranteed, and periodic review of the outputs and user feedback is required to ensure users are treated fairly.\n\n**Beyond Model Performance: Cost**\n\nA final, but important factor, is the cost of running your use case leveraging a certain model. LLMs costs can vary significantly based on several factors, including the type of model, its size, usage frequency, deployment environment, and the provider\'s pricing structure.\xa0  \n   \n There are scenarios where there can be up to a 20 x price variance between different models for the same use case. This is critical for business to consider alongside performance to ensure the solution is viable and allows for business value to be generated.\xa0\n\n**Conclusion**  \n   \n Benchmarking LLMs is a complex yet essential process that goes beyond mere performance evaluation. It encompasses a comprehensive assessment of quantitative and qualitative metrics, robustness, and ethical considerations such as bias and fairness.\xa0  \n   \n As LLMs continue to evolve and become integral to various applications, it is imperative for organizations to adopt a rigorous benchmarking framework. This framework ensures that the models not only perform optimally but also operate within ethical and secure boundaries, ultimately leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.\n\n# Contact Us\n\n---\n\nTo find out more about working with Capco and how we can help you overcome any potential challenges, contact our experts via the form below.\n\n© Capco 2025, A [Wipro](https://www.wipro.com "Wipro") Company\n\n ')]), SearchResults(query=Query(query='comparison of qualitative and quantitative metrics in LLM benchmarking'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://galileo.ai/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-evaluation-llm', title='Qualitative vs Quantitative LLM Evaluation', raw_content='Products\n\nDocs\n\nPricing\n\nBlog\n\nAbout\n\nLogin\n\nContact Sales\n\nSign Up\n\nBack\n\nContent\n\nQualitative vs Quantitative LLM Evaluation: Which Approach Best Fits Your Needs?\n\nConor Bronsdon\n\nHead of Developer Awareness\n\nConor Bronsdon\n\nHead of Developer Awareness\n\nConor Bronsdon\n\nHead of Developer Awareness\n\nMar 10, 2025\n\nEver tried judging a musical performance using only a frequency analyzer? You\'d miss the emotional impact, artistry, and audience connectionâ\x80\x94the very essence of what makes music meaningful.\n\nSimilarly, when it comes to evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), relying solely on quantitative metrics or purely on qualitative assessments can lead to an incomplete understanding. This is where the debate of Qualitative vs Quantitative LLM Evaluation Approaches becomes crucial.\n\nMost teams default to one approach or the other, creating blind spots that slow improvement and limit potential. Hereâ\x80\x99s why you need a blend of both approaches when evaluating your LLMs.\n\nQualitative vs Quantitative LLM Evaluation\n\nWhen evaluating Large Language Models, we typically employ two complementary methods: qualitative and quantitative LLM evaluation approaches. Quantitative evaluation focuses on numerical metrics that enable objective comparison, while qualitative evaluation examines the nuanced aspects of model outputs through human judgment or sophisticated analysis frameworks.\n\nThe most effective evaluation strategies combine both methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of model performance.\n\nWhat Are Qualitative LLM Evaluation Approaches?\n\nQualitative LLM evaluation approaches focus on assessing the subjective attributes and nuanced behaviors of language models through descriptive analysis rather than numerical metrics.\n\nThese methods examine aspects like coherence, relevance, and appropriateness that are difficult to capture with purely mathematical measures.\n\nSome common qualitative evaluation approaches include:\n\nHuman evaluation: Human evaluators analyze generated text to identify biases, stereotypes, and inaccuracies, providing insights that automated metrics might miss.\n\nAttribute discovery and assignment: As implemented in frameworks like QualEval, this approach identifies relevant domains and sub-tasks within datasets to provide a more granular understanding of model performance.\n\nReal-world testing: Test AI agents effectively by evaluating LLMs in practical scenarios and applications to assess their effectiveness in authentic contexts and ensure practical utility.\n\nQualitative evaluation puts "quality over quantity" by providing detailed insights into model behavior beyond simple metrics. These approaches typically result in comprehensive dashboards that highlight specific strengths and weaknesses across different domains, offering actionable guidance for model improvement.\n\nThe insights generated through qualitative analysis can significantly speed up the development lifecycle by pinpointing exactly where improvements should be made.\n\nWhat Are Quantitative LLM Evaluation Approaches?\n\nQuantitative LLM evaluation approaches rely on numerical metrics to objectively measure and compare model performance across various tasks. These methods produce consistent, reproducible results that can be easily tracked over time to measure progress in model development.\n\nQuantitative LLM evaluation approaches rely on numerical metrics, such as accuracy metrics to evaluate AI, to objectively measure and compare model performance across various tasks. These methods produce consistent, reproducible results that can be easily tracked over time to measure progress in model development.\n\nCommon quantitative evaluation metrics include:\n\nText quality metrics: Measurements like perplexity, BLEU metric, and ROUGE metrics in AI that assess the quality of generated text compared to reference outputs.\n\nClassification metrics: F1-score and other precision/recall measurements that evaluate how well models perform on classification tasks.\n\nTask-based metrics: Specific measurements that evaluate performance on downstream tasks like question answering, summarization, and translation.\n\nQuantitative evaluation provides clear benchmarks for comparing different models and tracking improvements during development. These metrics are particularly valuable for standardized evaluation across the field, allowing researchers and developers to communicate progress effectively.\n\nQuantitative approaches are typically more scalable and less resource-intensive than qualitative methods, making them suitable for continuous evaluation during training and fine-tuning.\n\nThe Differences Between Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches\n\nMeasurement focus: Quantitative methods measure performance through numerical metrics, while qualitative methods provide descriptive insights into model behavior and output quality.\n\nLevel of detail: Quantitative methods often distill performance into singular scalar values, while qualitative methods capture the complexities and nuances of model outputs.\n\nActionability: Quantitative metrics excel at benchmarking and comparison, while qualitative methods provide diagnostic insights that directly guide model improvements.\n\nHuman involvement: Quantitative methods are typically more automated, while qualitative approaches often require human judgment or sophisticated analysis frameworks.\n\nDevelopment impact: According to research on QualEval, qualitative approaches can boost model performance significantlyâ\x80\x94improving Llama 2 by up to 15 percentage points on challenging tasks.\n\nWhy You Need an Integrated LLM Evaluation Approach\n\nWhen evaluating Large Language Models, adopting either purely quantitative or purely qualitative metrics alone creates a blind spot in your assessment strategy. Employing effective AI evaluation methods that integrate both approaches helps to overcome these limitations.\n\nTraditional evaluation metrics often reduce complex model behaviors to single scalar values that fail to capture nuanced performance across diverse contexts and use cases.\n\nAddressing Limitations of Each Approach\n\nQuantitative metrics provide speed and scale but lack depth. Research on QualEval notes that "a single scalar to quantify and compare is insufficient to capture the fine-grained nuances of model behavior." These metrics benchmark models against each other but rarely offer actionable diagnostics for improvement.\n\nIn complex applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, it\'s important to evaluate LLMs for RAG using methods that address both qualitative and quantitative limitations.\n\nConversely, qualitative evaluations through Likert scales or preference judgments can detect subtle nuances but are inherently subjective and difficult to scale.\n\nEnhancing Depth and Breadth of Evaluation\n\nAn integrated approach combines the granularity of human insight with the scalability of automated metrics. This balance is crucialâ\x80\x94while automated evaluations can quickly process large amounts of data, they miss contextual nuances that human evaluators intuitively detect.\n\nBy employing strategies like LLM-as-a-Judge vs Human Evaluation, you can bridge this gap. This method helps identify complex patterns or errors that humans might overlook, while maintaining contextual understanding that pure metrics cannot achieve.\n\nProviding a Holistic View of AI Agent Performance\n\nCross-functional evaluation frameworks mirror success seen in other AI implementations. Just as a healthcare provider improved patient triage by involving clinicians, IT specialists, and patient advocates in a collaborative approach, LLM evaluation benefits from diverse perspectives. By applying metrics for evaluating AI agents, you can gain a holistic view of performance.\n\nWhen you integrate both qualitative and quantitative approaches, and utilize tools like the Agent Leaderboard, you create a comprehensive evaluation ecosystem that examines technical performance alongside real-world application. This translates raw metrics into meaningful insights about how your LLM will actually perform in production environments across diverse user scenarios.\n\nBalancing Objective Metrics with Contextual Insights\n\nThe most powerful evaluation strategies find the sweet spot between measurable performance and contextual understanding. As highlighted in AI model validation best practices, "balancing quantitative and qualitative analyses is crucial" to gain a comprehensive understanding of an LLM\'s capabilities and to effectively measure AI ROI.\n\nWhen you combine objective measurements with contextual feedback, you move beyond simply asking "how well does it perform?" to deeper questions like "how will it perform for specific users in real-world situations?"\n\nThis integrated approach transforms evaluation from a technical exercise into a strategic tool that drives meaningful improvements in your AI systems and better aligns them with actual user needs.\n\nA Real-World Example of Qualitative vs Quantitative LLM Evaluation Approaches\n\nLet\'s walk through a practical example of a medical diagnosis AI system used to detect lung cancers from radiological images. This represents an ideal case study for understanding how qualitative and quantitative LLM evaluation approaches work together.\n\nIn healthcare, the stakes are exceptionally highâ\x80\x94errors can directly impact patient outcomes. That\'s why medical AI systems benefit tremendously from comprehensive evaluation strategies that look beyond simple accuracy numbers.\n\nOn the quantitative side, the lung cancer detection AI is assessed through standard accuracy metrics, showing an impressive 92% overall accuracy. More nuanced metrics provide critical insights: precision might be 89%, while sensitivity could be 94%. Most importantly, the false-negative rateâ\x80\x94missing an existing cancerâ\x80\x94is tracked at 6%, while the false-positive rateâ\x80\x94incorrectly flagging healthy tissue as cancerousâ\x80\x94is at 11%.\n\nThese numbers give developers and healthcare institutions objective benchmarks against which to measure improvements.\n\nHowever, quantitative metrics alone tell an incomplete story. Qualitative evaluation provides context through case study analysis of complex diagnoses where the AI system struggled or excelled.\n\nDetailed examination of false-negative cases might reveal that the AI consistently misses certain rare subtypes of lung nodules with unusual presentation patterns. Additionally, radiologists reviewing AI recommendations provide feedback on the system\'s clinical reasoning.\n\nThese qualitative insights often reveal that while the AI performs well on common presentations, it might suggest inappropriate follow-up procedures for edge cases that experienced clinicians would handle differently.\n\nCombining these approaches creates a more comprehensive evaluation framework. The integrated assessment provides a fuller picture of AI performance across diverse patient populations and clinical scenarios.\n\nFor example, the quantitative metrics might suggest high performance, but qualitative analysis could reveal poor performance on images from older imaging equipmentâ\x80\x94identifying a clear area for improvement.\n\nThis combined approach builds trust among medical professionals when they see that the system has been rigorously evaluated both statistically and through realistic clinical scenarios.\n\nRadiologists who understand both the system\'s statistical performance and its reasoning patterns are more likely to adopt and appropriately rely on AI assistance, leading to better-integrated human-AI diagnostic workflows.\n\nStep Up Your LLM Evaluations with Galileo\n\nWhatever your approach to evaluating LLM, you need the right tools by your side.

However, with this rapid advancement comes the challenge of ensuring that these models perform reliably and ethically across different applications.\xa0  \n   \n Benchmarking LLMs has become a critical step in their use throughout the implementation lifecycle\xa0 , providing a structured way to evaluate model performance, robustness, and fairness. It is not just about testing the LLM on its own, but for the use case and data at hand which has a huge impact on performance and outputs.\xa0  \n   \n In this article we outline a framework for benchmarking LLMs, as well as highlighting the importance of validation at various stages of the life cycle, the value of both quantitative and qualitative metrics, and the need to address vulnerabilities and biases.\n\n# Benchmarking Large Language Models : Enhancing Reliability & Reducing Bias\n\n* Leo Ferrari, Caleb Severn, Srinivas Waghmare, Ghadir Abu Ahmad\n* Published: 09 December 2024\n\n**The LLM market is characterized by a high degree of complexity and rapid innovation. With the availability of numerous models, each boasting distinct capabilities, organizations face significant challenges in selecting the most suitable LLM for their specific use cases.**   \n The opaque nature of the training data used in proprietary models further complicates this process, making it difficult to fully understand their behaviours and potential risks. Additionally, traditional validation methods often fall short against the scale and complexity of modern LLMs, leading to potential issues in scalability and generalization.\xa0  \n   \n The need for a structured and rigorous benchmarking process is increasingly pressing, not only to minimise the risk of deploying suboptimal models but also to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory standards and ethical guidelines, ultimately building trust with stakeholders and driving innovation.\n\n**The Different Stages of LLM Validation**  \n   \n Effective LLM validation is not a one-size-fits-all process but rather a multi-faceted approach that requires careful consideration at each stage.  \n   \n As part of the full mode life cycle, after clearly defining the objectives and metrics that align with the intended use case (a crucial step setting the foundation for all subsequent evaluations) and preparing and cleaning the data, evaluation can be viewed as belonging to the following four major areas.\n\n**Quantitative Evaluation** – Quantitative metrics are employed to evaluate the model\'s performance. These metrics are task-specific and provide objective measures of how well the model is performing. While traditional classification metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1 score are useful for some tasks, LLMs often require more nuanced and task-specific metrics such as Rouge for summarization and text generation  \n   \n **Qualitative Evaluation** – Human evaluation plays a significant role in assessing the quality, coherence, and relevance of the model’s outputs. This stage helps identify areas where the model may perform well on paper but falls short in real-world applications.  \n   \n **Robustness Testing** – The model is tested against various adversarial inputs to assess its stability and security, identifying potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in real-world scenarios, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection.  \n   \n **Bias and Fairness Testing** – Finally, the model\'s outputs are examined for bias and fairness, ensuring that the LLM treats all demographics equitably and adheres to ethical standards. This stage is particularly important in applications where decisions can significantly impact people\'s lives\n\nEach stage of validation is necessary for the overall success of deploying LLMs, ensuring that the models not only perform well but also operate within ethical and secure boundaries. Although each stage demands investment of resource, effort, and expertise, omitting any one of them could lead to gaps that surface in production or can be exploited by malicious parties.\n\n**1. Quantitative metrics**\n\nQuantitative metrics form the starting of LLM evaluation, offering objective measures that help quantify a model’s performance across different tasks. These metrics are tailored to the specific tasks that LLMs are designed to perform, ranging from language modelling and text generation to machine translation and summarization. Industry benchmarks (such as HuggingFace’s LLM Leaderboard) can be useful for determining a shortlist of models and providers from the market that you may want to test for your use case. Figure 1 shows examples of quantitative metrics by task.\n\nFigure 1: Non-exhaustive list of quantitative metrics for LLMs, grouped by task\n\nDepending on your use case, you might consider LLM performance in the following areas:\n\n* **Text generation:** quality, coherence, relevance, and similarity of generated text compared to reference text or desired outputs\n* **Summarisation:** how accurately and comprehensively the generated summary captures key information and content\n* **Translation:** accuracy, fluency, and alignment of the translated text with the meaning and structure of original text\n* **Information retrieval:** relevance, accuracy, and ranking quality of retrieved documents or results in response to a query\n* **Question & answering:** accuracy, relevance, and completeness of the model\'s answers by comparing them to the correct or reference answers\n* **Speech Recognition:** accuracy and clarity of transcribed text by comparing it to the original spoken input\n* **Image captioning:** accuracy, relevance, and descriptiveness of generated captions by comparing them to human-written reference captions\n\nWhile quantitative metrics provide a robust framework for evaluating LLMs, they must be interpreted carefully, especially in the context of the specific use case. Published metrics often highlight strengths that may not fully align with the practical needs of an application, necessitating a more nuanced approach to their application.\n\nFigure 2: BLEU Summarisation Scores of LLMs\xa0 \xa0Llama3 (Meta), Gemma2 (Google), ChatGPT4o (OpenAI), and Luhn Summarisation Algorithm on BCBS 239 documentation, assessed across a range of uni-, bi-, tri- and quad-gram overlap weightings\n\nFor example, if you need an LLM to summarise text on BCBS documentation, you may choose Llama3 as it displays better overlap between the summarised and original text, as seen in Figure 2. However, if you wanted a summarisation that delineated different topics within the original text, ChatGPT-4o\xa0 could be better – something we will examine in a future article.  \n   \n Once you have shortlisted models to build into your pipeline, it is prudent to evaluate them using metrics that are bespoke to your use case and KPIs and tested on your data. For example, evaluating a model\'s suitability for finance and banking involves assessing its pre-training on financial texts, ease of fine-tuning with domain-specific data, and ability to transfer knowledge from general language tasks to finance-specific applications. This ensures the model performs well in the unique context of the financial sector.\n\n**2. Qualitative Metrics**  \n   \n While quantitative metrics provide numerical insights into an LLM’s performance, qualitative metrics capture the nuances that numbers alone cannot. These human-centric evaluations are useful for validating how well an LLM performs in real-world scenarios, where the subtleties of language, context, and user interaction play significant roles.\xa0  \n   \n Human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation approaches can enable continued SME involvement to understand model idiosyncrasies, mitigate risks and improve fidelity in a controlled environment before the model is deployed to production. Due to resource requirements (financial and FTE), this step could easily be omitted during prototyping but should be deeply considered before deployment, and should heavily involve business stakeholders to weigh against budget and timelines.\n\n\xa0 \xa0  \n   \n  Figure 3: Summary of HITL approaches with qualitative assessment of strengths; green denotes a strength of the approach, orange denotes an area to consider when employing the approach\n\n**3. Robustness Tests**  \n   \n As LLMs become more integral to various applications, their vulnerabilities also become more apparent. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by adversarial attacks, involving deliberately crafted inputs designed to trick the model into producing incorrect or harmful outputs. Addressing these vulnerabilities through robust defences is critical to ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs.  \n   \n Combating adversarial attacks can be a hugely laborious task, and it is reasonable that enterprise users of the LLMs expect the heavy lifting to be done by the providers. Nevertheless, providers can only do so much, so it is prudent to consider the defensive strategies that tech teams can incorporate into their processes:\n\n* **Hyperparameter tuning:** adjusting model parameters, such as temperature, can reduce the success of prompt injection attacks.\n* **Audit behaviour:** employ optimisation algorithms to identify elusive and undesirable model behaviours before deployment.\n* **Input/output filtering:** preprocess incoming data to identify and mitigate potential threats and anomalies and/or post-process model’s generated responses by blocking or modifying it to maintain ethical and safe interactions with LLMs.\n* **Human feedback integration:** incorporate human feedback and preferences directly into the pretraining phase rather than the fine-tuning stage to produce outputs that resonate more closely with human generations.\n* **Red teaming and adversarial training:** employ a dedicated group (human and automated techniques) using bespoke datasets simulating adversarial behaviours and attack strategies to identify vulnerability in the system, across hardware, software, and human elements.\n\n**4. Bias & Fairness**  \n   \n Ensuring that LLMs operate fairly across all demographic groups is a core principle of Responsible AI. Bias in the data that LLMs train on can lead to unequal treatment of users, perpetuating stereotypes and potentially causing harm in decision-making processes.\xa0  \n   \n Bias and fairness testing for LLMs focuses on evaluating model outputs across diverse demographic groups and contexts to identify disparities. It involves tasks like language generation, sentiment analysis, and classification, using diverse datasets and specific metrics to assess and ensure fairness and equity in model performance. The tests broadly cover the following approaches:\n\n* **Sentence completion tasks** with prompts that reveal biases in race, gender, religion, and other social categories (StereoSet, CrowS-Pairs, BOLD, WinoBias)\n* **Prediction or implicit association** of occupation or other attributes with social categories (Bias in Bios, WinoGender, SEAT)\n* **Using prompts** to elicit toxic responses (RealToxicityPrompts)\n\nEnsuring fairness in LLMs involves not only using diverse datasets and benchmarks but also continuously monitoring and updating the models to address emerging biases. While these tests primarily serve to diagnose biases, mitigating them is an integrated process where techniques such as prompt engineering can provide guardrails for the LLM when generating responses. However, total protection is not guaranteed, and periodic review of the outputs and user feedback is required to ensure users are treated fairly.\n\n**Beyond Model Performance: Cost**\n\nA final, but important factor, is the cost of running your use case leveraging a certain model. LLMs costs can vary significantly based on several factors, including the type of model, its size, usage frequency, deployment environment, and the provider\'s pricing structure.\xa0  \n   \n There are scenarios where there can be up to a 20 x price variance between different models for the same use case. This is critical for business to consider alongside performance to ensure the solution is viable and allows for business value to be generated.\xa0\n\n**Conclusion**  \n   \n Benchmarking LLMs is a complex yet essential process that goes beyond mere performance evaluation. It encompasses a comprehensive assessment of quantitative and qualitative metrics, robustness, and ethical considerations such as bias and fairness.\xa0  \n   \n As LLMs continue to evolve and become integral to various applications, it is imperative for organizations to adopt a rigorous benchmarking framework. This framework ensures that the models not only perform optimally but also operate within ethical and secure boundaries, ultimately leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.\n\n# Contact Us\n\n---\n\nTo find out more about working with Capco and how we can help you overcome any potential challenges, contact our experts via the form below.\n\n© Capco 2025, A [Wipro](https://www.wipro.com "Wipro") Company\n\n '), SearchResult(url='https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-prompt-evaluation/', title='Qualitative vs Quantitative Prompt Evaluation - Ghost', raw_content='By [Cesar Miguelañez](/author/cesar/)\n—\n\n# Qualitative vs Quantitative Prompt Evaluation\n\nExplore the difference between qualitative and quantitative prompt evaluation methods, and learn how combining both enhances AI performance.\n\n**Prompt evaluation is essential for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs).** There are two main approaches: **qualitative** (focused on clarity, coherence, and user satisfaction) and **quantitative** (focused on measurable metrics like accuracy, response time, and token usage). Combining both methods leads to better results, especially in critical fields like healthcare and finance.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n* **Qualitative Evaluation**: Uses expert reviews and human judgment to assess clarity, relevance, and coherence. Best for spotting biases and context-specific issues.\n* **Quantitative Evaluation**: Relies on data-driven metrics such as accuracy, latency, and consistency. Ideal for large-scale assessments and cost efficiency.\n* **Hybrid Approach**: Blends both methods, improving edge case detection by 40% and reducing errors in sensitive applications.\n\n### Quick Comparison:\n\n| Aspect | Qualitative Focus | Quantitative Focus |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Primary Metrics** | Clarity, Coherence | Accuracy, Token Usage |\n| **Success Indicators** | User Satisfaction | Performance Metrics |\n| **Best Use Cases** | Bias Detection, Contextual | Large-Scale Assessments |\n\nUsing both approaches together ensures better accuracy, fewer errors, and improved performance for LLM applications.\n\n## Qualitative vs Quantitative Methods\n\n### Qualitative Evaluation Methods\n\nQualitative methods focus on human judgment to evaluate how well prompts perform, often using expert analysis and structured reviews. These methods are especially useful in fields like healthcare, where combining clinician reviews with systematic assessments has led to a **54% drop in clinical guideline errors** [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/).\n\nExperts evaluate prompts based on factors like clarity (using precise instructions), relevance (through semantic analysis), and coherence (with structured rubrics). Research indicates that prompts with well-defined tasks can reduce follow-up questions by 38% [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/). In finance, applying these methods has resulted in development cycles that are 45% faster [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/).\n\n### Quantitative Evaluation Methods\n\nQuantitative methods, on the other hand, focus on measurable metrics to assess prompt performance. These approaches rely on data to provide objective insights, using clear performance indicators.\n\n| Metric | Target Threshold |\n| --- | --- |\n| Accuracy | >90% |\n| Response Latency | <2000ms |\n| Token Efficiency | Input-to-output ratio |\n| Consistency | <5% variance |\n\nThese methods are particularly effective in enterprise settings, where maintaining quality at scale is crucial. For example, legal tech companies often use hybrid scoring systems that combine multiple metrics to ensure consistent performance across their applications.\n\n## Method Comparison Analysis\n\n### Advantages and Limitations\n\nWhen evaluating prompts, it\'s crucial to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different methods. **Quantitative methods** stand out for their ability to handle large-scale assessments. For instance, in enterprise environments, automated quantitative evaluations can process over 15,000 test cases per hour, whereas qualitative methods manage only about 200 reviews per day [[1]](https://openshiro.com/articles/quantitative-and-qualitative-analysis-of-ai-generated-prompt-responses?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io)[[4]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/llm-evaluation/1032?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io).\n\nOn the other hand, **qualitative methods** shine when it comes to spotting nuanced issues. Expert reviewers using structured rubrics can identify **28% more demographic biases** in AI responses compared to automated metrics [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/)[[4]](https://www.projectpro.io/article/llm-evaluation/1032?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io). These human-driven evaluations are especially useful for assessing context and ethical considerations.\n\n| Aspect | Qualitative Evaluation | Quantitative Evaluation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Bias Detection | High accuracy | Limited detection |\n| Human rating variance vs machine consistency | 15-20% variability | Highly consistent |\n| Contextual Understanding | Deep insights | Surface-level analysis |\n\nThese trade-offs play a key role in deciding which method to use for specific scenarios.\n\n### Best Applications\n\nSome applications, like healthcare prompt systems, require both technical accuracy and domain expertise. In these cases, combining methods works best. Platforms such as [Latitude](https://latitude.so/?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io) support this by offering integrated workflows and tools for collaboration.\n\nFor tracking changes in model versions, **quantitative baselines** are invaluable. They allow teams to monitor performance metrics like semantic similarity scores over time. Meanwhile, qualitative assessments help uncover new issues, identifying **19% new error types** during recent model updates [[1]](https://openshiro.com/articles/quantitative-and-qualitative-analysis-of-ai-generated-prompt-responses?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io)[[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/).\n\nCost is another factor to consider. Modern platforms help address this by using AI-assisted evaluation tools, ensuring thorough reviews without breaking the budget. These tools balance efficiency with the need for rigorous assessments across evolving models.\n\n## Combined Evaluation Methods\n\n### Mixed-Method Frameworks\n\nBlending quantitative precision with qualitative insights has proven highly effective. For instance, research indicates hybrid approaches improve edge case detection by 40% compared to using a single method [[1]](https://openshiro.com/articles/quantitative-and-qualitative-analysis-of-ai-generated-prompt-responses?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io)[[3]](https://research.lesley.edu/c.php?g=1337506&p=9856190&ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io). These frameworks work particularly well when paired with tools that simplify and enhance hybrid evaluations.\n\n| Evaluation Component | Target Metrics | Weight |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Technical Performance | Latency <900ms, Token Usage <2048 | 70% |\n| User Experience | Coherence 4/5+, Relevance 85%+ | 30% |\n| Safety Checks | Bias Score <5%, Consistency >85% | Required |\n\n*Safety checks highlight how quantitative benchmarks (like bias scores) complement qualitative methods discussed earlier for detecting nuanced biases.*\n\n### Available Tools\n\nSeveral platforms cater to combined evaluation strategies. Latitude\'s evaluation dashboard is a standout, featuring integrated A/B testing with statistical significance markers (±5% confidence intervals) and expert feedback panels [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/)[[5]](https://nytlicensing.com/latest/marketing/what-is-content-development/?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io).\n\nFor enterprise use, modern platforms often include:\n\n* **Real-time metric dashboards** tracking both quantitative and qualitative data\n* **Version-controlled prompt histories** for systematic performance monitoring\n* **Collaborative annotation systems** to enable team-based reviews\n* **Automated bias detection** combined with human oversight\n\nThese tools deliver results. For example, one fintech company boosted FAQ accuracy from 72% to 89% within six weeks [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/)[[5]](https://nytlicensing.com/latest/marketing/what-is-content-development/?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io). This success combined quantitative tracking by NLP specialists with qualitative input from customer support teams.\n\nTop organizations allocate resources strategically: 60% for quantitative monitoring and 40% for qualitative validation [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/)[[5]](https://nytlicensing.com/latest/marketing/what-is-content-development/?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io). This balance underscores the importance of combining technical metrics with human-centered evaluations to optimize overall performance.\n\n## Next Steps in Evaluation\n\n### AI-Based Quality Review\n\nAI-driven quality review systems are now enhancing hybrid evaluation frameworks by offering better efficiency and maintaining strong accuracy levels. For example, recent AI explanation systems improved bias detection by 28% using advanced pattern recognition techniques in large language model (LLM) outputs [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/)[[3]](https://research.lesley.edu/c.php?g=1337506&p=9856190&ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io).\n\nOne standout example comes from the financial services sector, where a hybrid human-AI evaluation system delivered impressive results:\n\n> "Our hybrid evaluation system achieved a 45% reduction in evaluation cycles while improving coherence scores from 3.2 to 4.7 out of 5. Most importantly, we saw a 68% reduction in hallucination rates during customer service interactions." [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/)\n\nHowever, there are still challenges to address. These include increased computational time (+15-20ms per request), ongoing retraining costs ($2,000 per month), and limited transparency in decision-making processes (only 72% interpretability). These issues underscore the importance of hybrid systems to maintain balance in evaluations.\n\n### Metric Standardization\n\nEfforts to standardize evaluation metrics across LLM platforms are gaining momentum. The [OpenPrompt Initiative](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361063663_OpenPrompt_An_Open-source_Framework_for_Prompt-learning?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io) recently introduced cross-platform benchmarks, featuring a normalized 0-1 scoring system for 12 key metrics [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/).\n\nAdopting these benchmarks has already shown results. Customer support teams reported a 22% improvement in first-contact resolution rates, while financial systems reduced errors by 37% [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/). By combining quantitative thresholds with qualitative rubrics, modern frameworks have cut scoring inconsistencies by 40% [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/)[[6]](https://essaypro.com/blog/article-review?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io).\n\nStandardized metrics also help platforms like Latitude provide consistent results across different LLM ecosystems. Open-source projects like [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io) are speeding up adoption by offering 23 pre-built metric implementations and compatibility layers for various models. This approach has led to six times more adoption of new metrics compared to proprietary solutions [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/)[[3]](https://research.lesley.edu/c.php?g=1337506&p=9856190&ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io).\n\n## Summary\n\n### Main Points\n\nPrompt evaluation methods bring different advantages to the table. **Qualitative methods** enhance compliance with instructions by 87% [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/), while **quantitative methods** can handle over 500 prompts per hour [[1]](https://openshiro.com/articles/quantitative-and-qualitative-analysis-of-ai-generated-prompt-responses?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io). When combined, these approaches deliver a 40% improvement in quality by integrating human expertise with automated systems [[1]](https://openshiro.com/articles/quantitative-and-qualitative-analysis-of-ai-generated-prompt-responses?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io)[[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/). This balanced approach reflects workflows supported by platforms like Latitude, which blend technical analysis with human-centered evaluations.\n\n> "Quantitative first for enterprise applications, qualitative for clinical decision systems" - AI Product Manager at a Fortune 500 tech company [[1]](https://openshiro.com/articles/quantitative-and-qualitative-analysis-of-ai-generated-prompt-responses?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io)\n\nSpecialized sectors are seeing strong results. Organizations that use structured evaluation frameworks report better accuracy and efficiency across a range of applications.\n\n### Evaluation Method Selection\n\nChoosing the right evaluation method depends on the specific needs of the use case and operational limitations. Below is a breakdown of recommendations for various scenarios:\n\n| Use Case | Recommended Approach | Key Benefits |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Regulated Industries | Hybrid with Version Control | 60% reduction in audit time |\n| Customer Service | Mixed Methods | 38% fewer follow-ups |\n| High-Volume Processing | Quantitative-First | Handles 500+ prompts/hour |\n| Clinical Applications | Quality-Focused Hybrid | 54% fewer errors |\n\nIn sensitive areas like healthcare and finance, hybrid approaches are particularly valuable. Relying solely on automated metrics can result in a 23% error rate [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/), underscoring the need for human oversight in critical tasks.\n\nAI-powered evaluation systems are also making strides in reducing bias, with a 28% improvement in bias detection [[3]](https://research.lesley.edu/c.php?g=1337506&p=9856190&ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io). By combining automation with human judgment, these systems maintain efficiency while ensuring accurate, nuanced evaluations.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### What is the main difference between a qualitative test and a quantitative test?\n\nThe key difference between qualitative and quantitative prompt evaluations lies in their focus and how outcomes are measured. Quantitative tests rely on **hard data** - metrics like response times (e.g., 320ms on average), token usage patterns, and numerical accuracy rates [[1]](https://openshiro.com/articles/quantitative-and-qualitative-analysis-of-ai-generated-prompt-responses?ref=latitude-blog.ghost.io). On the other hand, qualitative tests assess **subjective qualities**, such as how coherent, contextually relevant, and clear the responses are. Both methods have their strengths, but combining them often provides the best balance, as highlighted in Combined Evaluation Methods.\n\n| Evaluation Type | Metrics & Methods | Practical Application |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Quantitative | Token count, API latency, error rates (<2%) | Handles 500+ prompts/hour |\n\nQuantitative testing is relatively affordable at $0.12 per 1,000 prompts, while qualitative reviews cost $8.75 each. However, hybrid approaches - achieving 92% accuracy at $2.40 per prompt - offer a cost-effective middle ground for most organizations [[2]](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/blog/qualitative-metrics-for-prompt-evaluation/). Modern platforms streamline this process by integrating both evaluation types into a single workflow, ensuring efficiency without compromising accuracy.\n\n## Related Blog Posts\n\n* [Prompt Engineering vs Traditional Programming: Key Differences](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/https:/latitude.so/blog/prompt-engineering-vs-traditional-programming-key-differences/)\n* [Collaborative Prompt Engineering: Best Tools and Methods](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/https:/latitude.so/blog/collaborative-prompt-engineering-best-tools-and-methods/)\n* [Key Roles in Prompt Design Teams](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/https:/latitude.so/blog/key-roles-in-prompt-design-teams/)\n* [Evaluating Prompts: Metrics for Iterative Refinement](https://latitude-blog.ghost.io/https:/latitude.so/blog/evaluating-prompts-metrics-for-iterative-refinement/)')])]}}

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ["# Performance Metrics for Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nThe evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is essential for determining their effectiveness, reliability, and safety in a variety of real-world applications. Performance metrics serve as the framework for this evaluation, providing a structured way to assess how well these models perform across different tasks. This section will explore key performance metrics, including accuracy, fluency, coherence, and the significance of standardized benchmarks in model evaluation.\n\n## Key Concepts and Definitions\n\n### Performance Metrics\nPerformance metrics are critical tools used to objectively measure the performance of LLMs on various linguistic tasks. These metrics facilitate comparisons between models, track progress over time, and inform model development. \n\n- **Accuracy**: This metric assesses the degree to which the model's outputs match the expected results. In classification tasks, accuracy is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances. While accuracy is a fundamental measure, it can be misleading when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where certain classes are underrepresented.\n\n- **Fluency**: Fluency is a qualitative measure that evaluates the naturalness and readability of generated text. A fluent model produces text that adheres to grammatical conventions and resembles human writing. Fluency can be assessed through both human evaluations and quantitative measures derived from language models that predict the likelihood of word sequences.\n\n- **Coherence**: Coherence evaluates the logical consistency and contextual relevance of the generated text. It encompasses the logical flow of ideas and the connections between sentences and paragraphs. Coherence is often assessed by expert human annotators who examine the structural and thematic continuity of the text.\n\n### Evaluation Frameworks\nEvaluation frameworks define structured methodologies for assessing LLMs, which include the selection of appropriate metrics and datasets. They ensure that evaluations are comprehensive and aligned with the specific tasks for which the models are designed.\n\n### Benchmarks\nBenchmarks are standardized tests and datasets used for evaluating LLM performance. They provide a consistent basis for comparison across different models and tasks. Notable benchmarks include:\n\n- **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**: Assesses a model's capabilities across multiple academic subjects.\n- **TruthfulQA**: Measures the accuracy of responses against potentially misleading questions.\n- **HumanEval**: Focuses on the model's ability to generate correct code based on natural language descriptions.\n\n## Importance of Performance Metrics\n\nPerformance metrics play a vital role in the development and deployment of LLMs. They not only facilitate the comparison of models but also help to track improvements over time and guide ongoing research. The multi-dimensional nature of language necessitates that metrics account for correctness, coherence, and contextual relevance, as traditional metrics may not adequately capture the nuances of language generation.\n\n### Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics\n- **Quantitative Metrics**: These include measures such as perplexity, BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). Perplexity assesses a model's ability to predict the next word in a sequence, with lower values indicating better performance. BLEU evaluates the similarity between generated text and reference texts, particularly in translation tasks, while ROUGE measures the quality of summarization by calculating the recall of key elements.\n\n- **Qualitative Metrics**: Human evaluations are essential for capturing aspects such as coherence and ethical implications that automated systems may overlook. Human reviewers can provide insights into subtle issues, such as the appropriateness of content in sensitive situations.\n\n## Challenges in Evaluation\n\nEvaluating LLMs presents several challenges that must be addressed to ensure reliable assessments:\n\n- **Subjectivity and Biases**: Human evaluations can introduce biases and inconsistencies, complicating the establishment of a reliable ground truth. This can affect the overall assessment of model performance.\n\n- **Overfitting to Benchmarks**: There is a risk that models may perform well on benchmarks while failing to generalize to real-world applications. This can lead to inflated performance scores that do not reflect practical usability.\n\n- **Dynamic Language**: The evolving nature of language necessitates continual refinement of benchmarks, as static evaluations may become outdated quickly.\n\n## Best Practices for Evaluation\n\nTo enhance the reliability and effectiveness of model evaluations, several best practices should be adopted:\n\n- **Diverse Datasets**: Using a variety of datasets that reflect real-world scenarios can improve evaluation reliability and help minimize biases.\n\n- **Multiple Metrics**: Employing a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics allows for a more comprehensive assessment, capturing both numerical performance and qualitative attributes of model outputs.\n\n- **Continuous Evaluation**: Implementing ongoing evaluations in real-world contexts ensures that models remain relevant and adaptable to changing user needs and linguistic trends.\n\n## Supporting Evidence and Examples\n\nThe necessity of robust evaluation frameworks has been emphasized across various studies. For instance, the Databricks Blog highlights the importance of ensuring that LLM outputs are safe, coherent, and contextually relevant, particularly in high-stakes environments. Research findings from AIMultiple underscore the significance of selecting appropriate benchmarks, such as MMLU and TruthfulQA, to facilitate effective model comparisons and inform development strategies. Furthermore, insights from Aisera point to the need for context-specific evaluations tailored to the unique demands of applications like educational tools and customer service bots.\n\n## Contrasting Viewpoints\n\nThere exists a debate within the field regarding the reliance on automated metrics versus the irreplaceable value of human judgment in evaluating LLM outputs. While some researchers emphasize the efficiency of automated metrics, others argue that human evaluations are critical, particularly in sensitive domains where ethical considerations must be taken into account. This discussion highlights the complexity of evaluating language models and the need for a balanced approach that incorporates multiple evaluation strategies."], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='performance metrics for large language models accuracy fluency coherence evaluation'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.databricks.com/blog/best-practices-and-methods-llm-evaluation', title='Best Practices and Methods for LLM Evaluation', raw_content='---\n\n# Best Practices and Methods for LLM Evaluation\n\nPublished:October 28, 2025\n\n[Data Science and ML](/blog/category/engineering/data-science-machine-learning)7 min read\n\nby [Ana Nieto](/blog/author/ana-nieto)\n\nShare this post\n\nKeep up with us\n\n#### Summary\n\n* Learn the fundamentals of large language model (LLM) evaluation, including key metrics and frameworks used to measure model performance, safety, and reliability.\n* Explore practical evaluation techniques, such as automated tools, LLM judges, and human assessments tailored for domain-specific use cases.\n* Understand the best practices for LLM evaluation, as well as some of the future directions like advanced and multi-agent LLM systems.\n\n## Understanding LLM Evaluation\n\nAs more companies lean into the technology and promise of [artificial intelligence](https://www.databricks.com/product/artificial-intelligence) (AI) systems to drive their businesses, many are implementing [large language models](https://www.databricks.com/product/machine-learning/large-language-models) (LLMs) to process and produce text for various applications. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language, and they can be deployed in systems such as chatbots, content generation and coding assistance.\n\nLLMs like Open AI’s GPT-4.1, Anthropic’s Claude, and open-source models such as Meta’s Llama leverage deep learning techniques to process and produce text. But these are still nascent technologies, making it crucial to frequently evaluate their performance for reliability, efficiency and ethical considerations prior to – and throughout – their deployment. In fact, regular evaluation of LLMs can:\n\n1. Ensure that models generate accurate, coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n2. Allow researchers and developers to continually compare models and identify areas for improvement.\n3. Prevent any biases, misinformation or harmful content.\n\nNearly every industry – from healthcare and finance, to education and electronics – are relying on LLMs to give them a competitive edge, and robust evaluation procedures are critical to maintaining high standards in [LLM development](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/llmops). In fact, as enterprises increasingly deploy LLMs into customer-facing and high-stakes domains, robust evaluation is the linchpin for safe, reliable and [cost-effective GenAI](https://www.databricks.com/discover/generative-ai) adoption.\n\nLLM evaluation involves three fundamental pieces:\n\n**Evaluation metrics:** These metrics are used to assess a model’s performance based on predefined criteria, such as accuracy, coherence or bias.\n\n**Datasets:** This is the data against which the LLM\'s outputs are compared. High-quality [datasets](https://www.databricks.com/spark/getting-started-with-apache-spark/datasets) help provide an objective ground truth for evaluation.\n\n**Evaluation frameworks:** Structured methodologies and tools help facilitate the assessment process, which ensures the results are consistent and reliable.\n\n## Exploring LLM Evaluation Metrics\n\nThere are numerous methods by which LLMs can be evaluated, but they can broadly be classified as either quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative metrics rely on numerical scores derived from automated assessments and provide objective and scalable insights. Qualitative metrics involve human judgment, assessing aspects like fluency, coherence and ethical considerations.\n\n[LLM evaluation](https://www.databricks.com/blog/LLM-auto-eval-best-practices-RAG) metrics can also be categorized based on their dependency on reference outputs:\n\n**Reference-based metrics:** These compare model outputs to a set of predefined correct responses. Some examples of reference-based metrics include:\n\n* **The Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU):** Originally designed for machine translation, BLEU measures n-gram overlap between machine-generated and reference text, focusing on precision.\n* **The Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE):** Commonly used in summarization, ROUGE assesses how much of the reference content is captured in the model output.\n\n**Reference-free metrics** assess outputs without requiring a reference answer, and instead focus on the intrinsic qualities of a generated text. They are useful for evaluating open-ended text generation tasks, where a single "correct" reference may not exist or be appropriate, such as dialogue systems, creative writing or reasoning-based outputs.\n\nSome examples of reference-free metrics include:\n\n* **Perplexity:** This approach measures how well a model predicts the next word in a sequence. Lower perplexity implies better predictive capability, though it doesn’t always correlate with generation quality in real-world tasks.\n* **Toxicity and bias:** Users must ensure LLM outputs avoid issues like bias, harmful content, disinformation, misinformation or hallucination. Tools like RealToxicityPrompts provide benchmark prompts to test for toxic degeneration in LLM outputs.\n* **Coherence:** This refers to the ability of a model to stay focused on a specific theme or idea. Coherence scores evaluate things like linguistic structure, semantic consistency and logical progression within the text itself.\n\nAside from reference-based and reference-free metrics, there are other benchmarks researchers can use to evaluate the quality of an LLM’s output.\n\n1. **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU):** This benchmark evaluates a model’s performance across multiple domains, testing its general knowledge and reasoning abilities.\n2. **Recall-Oriented Tasks:** These include metrics like ROUGE, which assess how well a model retrieves and synthesizes information.\n3. **BERTScore:** Evaluates text generation by comparing the similarity between model-generated text and a reference using contextual embeddings from the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). This is a reference-based metric using contextual embeddings from BERT to measure semantic similarity between generated and reference text.\n\n## Best Practices for LLM Evaluation\n\nThe first step in evaluating an LLM is to use a dataset that is diverse, representative and unbiased. It should include real-world scenarios to assess the model’s performance in practical applications.\n\nAdditionally, by curating datasets from various sources, you can ensure coverage across multiple domains and incorporate opposing examples to enhance the evaluation process.\n\nOne technique for evaluating outputs is the LLM-as-a-Judge, where an [AI model](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/ai-models) is used to evaluate another AI model according to predefined criteria. This solution can be scalable and efficient and is ideal for text-based products such as chatbots, Q&A systems or agents. The success of these LLM judges hinges on the quality of the prompt, model and complexity of the task.\n\nWhile automated metrics provide consistency and scalability, real humans are essential for assessing nuances in generated text, such as coherence, readability and ethical implications. Crowdsourced annotators or subject matter experts can provide qualitative assessments on quality and accuracy of an LLM’s outputs.\n\nIt is important to determine what factors will guide an evaluation, as each context requires a tailored evaluation approach. For example, LLMs used in customer service must be assessed for accuracy and sentiment alignment, while those used in creative writing should be evaluated for originality and coherence.\n\n## Frameworks and Tools for LLM Evaluation\n\nThere are a number of frameworks for measuring whether an LLM’s output is accurate, safe and governed. The leading frameworks for LLM evaluation leverage some of the industry standard natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks, but they still struggle to evaluate complex, enterprise-scale AI systems like agents and [RAG pipelines](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag). Some of those issues include:\n\n* Choosing the right metrics to evaluate the quality of the application.\n* Collecting human feedback efficiently to measure the quality of the application.\n* Identifying the root cause of quality problems.\n* Rapidly iterating on the quality of the application before deploying to production.\n\nThat’s why Databricks introduced [Mosaic AI Agent Framework and Agent Evaluation](https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-mosaic-ai-agent-framework-and-agent-evaluation), built directly into the [Databricks Data Intelligence Platform](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-intelligence-platform).\n\nAgent Evaluation helps you assess the quality, cost and latency of agentic applications – from development through production – with a unified set of tools:\n\n* **Integrated LLM judges:** Proprietary evaluation agents rate your model’s responses on groundedness, correctness, clarity, and coherence. Each response is scored with supporting rationale to help identify root causes of quality issues.\n* **Custom metrics and guidelines:** Define your own evaluation criteria, such as tone or regulatory compliance, to tailor feedback to your domain and use case.\n* **Offline and online consistency:** Evaluation is unified across dev (offline) and production (online) environments, making it easy to monitor drift and improve over time.\n* **Seamless integration with MLflow:** All evaluation results, metrics and traces are logged automatically. This can help enable A/B testing, continuous monitoring and a clear audit trail.\n\nWhether you’re building a chatbot, a data assistant, or a complex multi-agent system, [Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation](https://www.databricks.com/product/machine-learning/retrieval-augmented-generation) helps you systematically improve quality and reduce risk—without slowing down innovation.\n\n## Challenges in LLM Evaluation\n\nA major challenge in LLM evaluation is ensuring responses are relevant and domain-specific. Generic benchmarks may be able to measure overall coherence, but they may struggle to accurately reflect performance in specialized fields. This is why LLM evaluations can’t be applied as a one-size-fits-all solution, but must be customized and built to address your specific organizational needs.\n\nLLMs may also generate responses that are correct but differ from predefined reference answers, which can make it difficult to evaluate. Techniques such as embedding-based similarity measures and adversarial testing can improve the reliability of these assessments.\n\nModern LLMs can also demonstrate few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities. A zero-shot learning technique allows an LLM to take advantage of its learned reasoning patterns, while few-shot learning is a technique in which LLMs are prompted with concrete examples. While novel in their abilities, evaluating them can be tricky as it requires benchmarks that test reasoning and adaptability. Dynamic evaluation datasets and meta-learning approaches are two of the emerging solutions that can help enhance few-shot and zero-shot assessment methods.\n\nIt’s important to note that LLM judges may inherit the biases or blind spots of any evaluating LLM. Human oversight is essential to account for a layer of critical judgment and contextual awareness that models simply cannot achieve. This can include spotting subtle errors, hallucinated references, ethical concerns, or responses based on lived experience.\n\n## Future Directions in LLM Evaluation\n\nAs LLMs continue to evolve, our methods to evaluate them must also grow. While current tools can evaluate single-agent, text-only LLMs, future evaluations will need to assess quality, factual consistency and reasoning ability across multi-modal inputs. These multi-agent and tool-use LLMs operate in more complex environments where reasoning, coordination and interaction with things like search engines, calculators or APIs are central to their functionality. And in the case of tool-use LLMs, which actively seek information and perform tasks in real time, evaluating the accuracy, safety and efficacy must evolve from traditional tools. As a result, benchmarks will need to simulate environments where agents must collaborate, negotiate or compete to solve tasks.\n\nLooking ahead, the path forward requires continuous innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration. Future LLM evaluation practices must integrate real-world feedback loops and ensure models align with human values and ethical standards. By embracing open research and rigorous testing methodologies, LLMs can become safer, more reliable and more capable language models.\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Compact Guide to LLMs](https://www.databricks.com/resources/guide/boost-genai-roi-ai-agents)\n* [BB of GenAI](https://www.databricks.com/resources/ebook/big-book-generative-ai)\n* [AI Toolkit](https://www.databricks.com/resources/ebook/ai-toolkit-ai-agents)\n\nKeep up with us\n\nShare this post\n\n## Never miss a Databricks post\n\nSubscribe to our blog and get the latest posts delivered to your inbox\n\n## Sign up\n\n## What\'s next?\n\n[Data Science and ML\n\nOctober 1, 2024/5 min read\n\n#### Build Compound AI Systems Faster with Databricks Mosaic AI](/blog/build-compound-ai-systems-faster-databricks-mosaic-ai)\n\n[Healthcare & Life Sciences\n\nNovember 14, 2024/2 min read\n\n#### Providence Health: Scaling ML/AI Projects with Databricks Mosaic AI](/blog/providence-health-automl)'), SearchResult(url='https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-evaluation/', title='Large Language Model Evaluation: 10+ Metrics & Methods', raw_content='No results found.\n\n[AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/category/ai/)[LLMs](https://aimultiple.com/llm)\n\n# Large Language Model Evaluation: 10+ Metrics & Methods\n\n[Cem Dilmegani](https://research.aimultiple.com/author/cem-dilmegani/)\n\nupdated on\xa0Sep 19, 2025\n\nSee our[ethical norms](https://aimultiple.com/commitments)\n\n[Large Language Model](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models/) evaluation (i.e., LLM eval) refers to the multidimensional assessment of [large language models (LLMs](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models-examples/)). Effective evaluation is crucial for selecting and optimizing LLMs.\n\nEnterprises have a range of base models and their variations to choose from, but achieving success is uncertain without precise performance measurement. To ensure the best results, it is vital to identify the most suitable evaluation methods as well as the [appropriate data](https://research.aimultiple.com/data-quality-ai/) for training and assessment.\n\nSee evaluation [metrics](#evaluation-metrics) and [methods,](#llm-evaluation-tools-frameworks) how to address [challenges with current evaluation models](#what-are-the-common-challenges-with-existing-llm-evaluation-methods), and [solutions to mitigate](#best-practices-to-overcome-problems-of-large-language-model-evaluation-methods) them.\n\nFor quick definitions and references, check out the [glossary of key terms](#glossary-of-key-terms).\n\n## Top models & metrics for specific aims\n\nWe created a summary of the best datasets and metrics for your specific aims:\n\n## 5 steps of benchmarking LLMs\n\n### 1. Benchmark selection\n\nA combination of benchmarks is often necessary to comprehensively evaluate a language model’s performance. A set of benchmark tasks is selected to cover a wide range of language-related challenges. These tasks may include language modeling, text completion, [sentiment analysis](https://research.aimultiple.com/sentiment-analysis-benchmark/), question answering, summarization, machine translation, and more. [LLM benchmarks](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models-examples/) should represent real-world scenarios and cover diverse domains and linguistic complexities. Hugging Face has a leaderboard to evaluate, discuss, and list current Open LLMs.[1](#easy-footnote-bottom-1-68488 "https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/")\n\nSticking to the same benchmarking methods and datasets can create metric problems in LLM evaluation and lead to unchanging results. We advise updating your benchmark and evaluation metrics to capture LLM’s various capabilities. Some of the most popular benchmarking datasets are:\n\n* **MMLU-Pro** refines the MMLU dataset by offering ten choices per question, requiring more reasoning and reducing noise through expert review.[2](#easy-footnote-bottom-2-68488 "https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro")\n* **GPQA** features challenging questions designed by domain experts, validated for difficulty and factuality, and is accessible only through gating mechanisms to prevent contamination.[3](#easy-footnote-bottom-3-68488 "https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa")\n* **MuSR** consists of algorithmically generated complex problems, requiring models to use reasoning and long-range context parsing, with few models performing better than random.[4](#easy-footnote-bottom-4-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/TAUR-Lab/MuSR")\n* **MATH** is a compilation of difficult high-school-level competition problems, formatted for consistency, focusing on the hardest questions.[5](#easy-footnote-bottom-5-68488 "https://github.com/hendrycks/math")\n* **IFEval** tests models’ ability to follow explicit instructions and formatting using strict metrics for evaluation.[6](#easy-footnote-bottom-6-68488 "https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/tasks/ifeval/README.md")\n* **BBH** includes 23 challenging tasks from the BigBench dataset, measuring objective metrics and language understanding, and correlates well with human preference.[7](#easy-footnote-bottom-7-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukaemon/bbh")\n* **HumanEval** evaluates the performance of an LLM in code generation, focusing particularly on its functional correctness.[8](#easy-footnote-bottom-8-68488 "https://github.com/openai/human-eval")\n* **TruthfulQA**\xa0addresses hallucination problems by measuring an LLM’s ability to generate true answers.[9](#easy-footnote-bottom-9-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/domenicrosati/TruthfulQA")\n* **General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)** and **SuperGLUE** test the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly for language-understanding tasks.[10](#easy-footnote-bottom-10-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue")\n\nKey research takeaways also include the need for better benchmarking, collaboration, and innovation to push the boundaries of LLM capabilities.\n\n### 2. Dataset preparation\n\nUsing either custom-made or open-source datasets is acceptable. The key point is that the dataset should be recent enough so that the LLMs have not yet been trained on it.\n\nCurated [datasets](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-data/),\xa0including [training](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-training/), validation, and test sets, are prepared for each benchmark task. These datasets should be large enough to capture\xa0variations in language use, domain-specific nuances, and potential biases. Careful data curation is essential to ensure high-quality and unbiased evaluation.\n\n### 3. Model training and fine-tuning\n\nModels trained as [large language models (LLMs)](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-training/) undergo [fine-tuning](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-fine-tuning/#why-or-when-does-your-business-need-a-fine-tuned-llm) to improve task-specific performance. The process typically begins with pre-training on large text sources like Wikipedia or the Common Crawl, allowing the model to learn language patterns and structures, forming the base for generative AI coding and generating human-like text.\n\nAfter pre-training, LLMs are fine-tuned on specific benchmark datasets to enhance [performance](https://research.aimultiple.com/how-to-measure-ai-performance/) in tasks like translation or summarization. These models vary in size, from small to large, and use transformer-based designs. Alternative training methods are often employed to boost their capabilities.\n\n### 4. Model evaluation\n\nThe trained or fine-tuned LLM models are evaluated on the benchmark tasks using the predefined evaluation metrics. The models’ performance is measured based on their ability to generate accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate responses for each task. The evaluation results provide insights into the LLM models’ strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance.\n\n### 5. Comparative analysis\n\nThe evaluation results are analyzed to compare the performance of different LLM models on each benchmark task. Models are ranked based on their overall performance or task-specific metrics. Comparative analysis allows researchers and practitioners to identify state-of-the-art models, track progress over time, and understand the relative strengths of different models for specific tasks.\n\nFigure 1: Top 10 ranking of different Large Language Models based on their performance metrics.[11](#easy-footnote-bottom-11-68488 "https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/")\n\n## Evaluation metrics\n\nChoosing a benchmarking method and evaluation metrics to define the overall evaluation criteria based on the model’s intended use are almost simultaneous tasks. Numerous metrics are used for evaluation.\n\nThese particular quantitative or qualitative measurement methods evaluate certain facets of LLM performance. With differing degrees of connection to human assessments, they offer numerical or categorical scores that may be monitored over time and compared between models.\n\n### [General performance metrics](https://research.aimultiple.com/machine-learning-accuracy/)\n\n* **Accuracy** is the percentage of correct responses in binary tasks.\n* **Recall** is the actual number of true positives versus false ones in LLM responses.\n* **F1 score** blends accuracy and recall into one metric. F1 scores range from 0–1, with 1 signifying excellent recall and precision.\n* **Latency is the** model’s efficiency and speed.\n* **Toxicity** shows the immunity of the model to harmful or offensive content in the outputs.\n* **Elo ratings for AI models** rank language models based on competitive performance in shared tasks, similar to how chess players are ranked. Models compete by generating outputs for the same tasks, and ratings are adjusted as new models or tasks are introduced.\n\n### Text-specific metrics\n\n* **Coherence** is the score of the logical flow and consistency of the generated text.\n* **Diversity** measures assess the variety and uniqueness of the generated responses. It involves analyzing metrics such as n-gram diversity or measuring the semantic similarity between generated responses. Higher diversity scores indicate more diverse and unique outputs.\n* **Perplexity** is a measure used to evaluate the performance of language models. It quantifies how well the model predicts a sample of text. Lower perplexity values indicate better performance.\n\nFigure 2: Examples of perplexity evaluation.\n\n* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** is a metric used in machine translation tasks. It compares the generated output with one or more reference translations and measures their similarity.\xa0BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better performance.\n\n* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gissing Evaluation)** is a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries. It compares the generated summary with one or more reference summaries and calculates precision, recall, and F1 scores (Figure 3). ROUGE scores provide insights into the language model’s summary generation capabilities.\n\nFigure 3: An example of a ROUGE evaluation process.[12](#easy-footnote-bottom-12-68488 "https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-text-summarization-with-rouge-scores-84140c64b471/")\n\nEvaluation metrics can be judged by a model or a human. Both have their own advantages and use cases:\n\n### LLM evaluating LLMs\n\nThe LLM assesses the caliber of its own products in an examination known as LLM-as-a-judge. This could involve comparing model-generated text to ground-truth data or measuring outcomes with statistical metrics like accuracy and F1.\n\nLLM-as-a-judge provides businesses with high efficiency by quickly assessing millions of outputs at a fraction of the expense of human review. It is suitable for large-scale deployments where speed and resource optimization are crucial success factors because it is adequate at evaluating technical content in situations where qualified reviewers are hard to come by, allows for continuous quality monitoring of AI systems, and produces repeatable results that hold true throughout evaluation cycles.\n\n### Human-in-the-loop evaluation\n\nThe evaluation process includes enlisting human evaluators who assess the language model’s output quality. These evaluators rate the generated responses based on different criteria: relevance, fluency, coherence, and overall quality.\xa0This approach offers subjective feedback on the model’s performance.\n\nHuman evaluation is still crucial for high-stakes enterprise applications where mistakes could cause serious harm to the company’s operations or reputation. Human reviewers are excellent at identifying subtle problems with cultural context, ethical implications, and practical usefulness that automated systems frequently overlook. They also meet regulatory requirements for human oversight in sensitive industries such as healthcare, finance, and legal services.\n\n## LLM evaluation tools & frameworks\n\nLLM evaluation can be performed in two ways: you can conduct it yourself using either open-source or commercial frameworks or pre-calculated values from benchmarks or results from open-source frameworks of the base models.\n\n### Open-source frameworks\n\n#### Comprehensive evaluation frameworks\n\nComprehensive evaluation frameworks are integrated systems that provide a variety of metrics and evaluation techniques in a unified testing environment. They usually offer defined benchmarks, test suites, and reporting systems to evaluate LLMs across a range of capabilities and dimensions.\n\n* **LEval (Language Model Evaluation)** is a framework for evaluating LLMs on long-context understanding.[13](#easy-footnote-bottom-13-68488 "https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LEval")  LEval is a benchmark suite featuring 411 questions across eight tasks, with contexts from 5,000 to 200,000 tokens. It evaluates how well models perform information retrieval and reasoning with lengthy documents. The suite includes tasks like academic summarization, technical document generation, and multi-turn dialogue coherence, allowing researchers to test models on practical applications rather than isolated linguistic tasks.\n* **Prometheus** is an open-source framework that uses LLMs as judges with systematic prompting strategies.[14](#easy-footnote-bottom-14-68488 "https://huggingface.co/prometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0")  It’s designed to produce evaluation scores that align with human preferences and judgment.\n\n#### Testing approaches\n\nTesting approaches are methodological techniques for organizing and carrying out assessments that are not dependent on particular metrics or instruments. They specify experimental designs, sample techniques, and testing philosophies that can be applied with different frameworks.\n\n* **DAG (Deep Acyclic Graph)** evaluation workflows use directed acyclic graphs to represent evaluation pipelines, though it’s not a specific evaluation tool.\n* **Dynamic prompt testing** evaluates models by exposing them to evolving, real-world scenarios that mimic user interaction. This method evaluates how models respond to complex, multi-layered queries & ambiguous prompts.\n* **The energy and hardware efficiency benchmark** framework measures the energy consumption and computational efficiency of models during training and inference. It focuses on sustainability metrics, such as carbon emissions and power usage.\n\n### Commercial evaluation platforms\n\nCommercial evaluation platforms are vendor-provided solutions with compliance features, MLOps pipeline integration, and user-friendly interfaces that are intended for enterprise use cases. They frequently have monitoring capabilities and strike a compromise between technical depth and non-technical stakeholders’ accessibility.\n\n* **DeepEval (Confident AI)** is a developer-focused testing framework that helps evaluate LLM applications using predefined metrics for accuracy, bias, and performance. It interfaces with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.\n* **Azure AI Studio Evaluation (Microsoft)** offers built-in evaluation tools for comparing different models and prompts, with automatic metric tracking and human feedback collection capabilities.\n* **Prompt Flow (Microsoft)** is a development tool for building, evaluating, and deploying LLM applications. Its built-in evaluation capabilities allow for systematic testing across models and prompts.\n* **LangSmith (LangChain)** is a platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring LLM applications, with features for comparing models and tracing execution paths.\n* **TruLens (TruEra)** is an open-source toolkit for evaluating and explaining LLM applications, with features for tracking hallucinations, relevance, and groundedness.\n* **Vertex AI Studio (Google)** provides tools to test and evaluate model outputs, with both automatic metrics and human evaluation capabilities within Google’s AI ecosystem.\n* **Amazon Bedrock** includes evaluation capabilities for foundation models, allowing developers to test and compare different models before deployment.\n* **Parea AI** is a platform for evaluating and monitoring LLM applications with a specific focus on data quality and model performance.\n\n### Pre-evaluated benchmarks\n\nPre-evaluated benchmarks provide valuable insights using specific metrics, making them particularly useful for metric-driven analysis. Our website features benchmarks for leading models, helping you assess performance effectively. Key benchmarks include:\n\n* [**Hallucination**](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-hallucination/) – Evaluates the accuracy and factual consistency of generated content.\n* [**AI Coding**](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-code/) – Measures coding ability, correctness, and execution.\n* [**AI Reasoning**](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-reasoning/) – Assesses logical inference and problem-solving capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the **OpenLLM Leaderboard** offers a live benchmarking system that evaluates models on publicly available datasets. It aggregates scores from tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering, providing a dynamic and up-to-date comparison of model performance.\n\n## Evaluation use cases\n\n### 1. Performance assessment\n\nConsider an enterprise that needs to choose between multiple models for its base [enterprise generative model](https://research.aimultiple.com/enterprise-generative-ai/). These LLMs must be evaluated to assess how well they generate text and respond to input. Performance assessment metrics can include **accuracy**, **fluency**, **coherence**, and **subject relevance**.\n\nWith the advent of [large multimodal models](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-multimodal-models/), enterprises can also evaluate models that process and generate multiple data types, such as **[images](https://research.aimultiple.com/image-recognition-vs-classification/)**, **text**, and **[audio](https://research.aimultiple.com/audio-data-collection/)**, expanding the scope and capabilities of [generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-services/).\n\n### 2. Model comparison\n\nAn enterprise may have fine-tuned a model for higher performance in tasks specific to its industry. An evaluation framework helps researchers and practitioners compare LLMs and measure progress, helping them select the most appropriate model for a given application. LLM evaluation’s ability to pinpoint areas for development and opportunities to address deficiencies might result in a better user experience, fewer risks, and even a possible competitive advantage.\n\n### 3. Bias detection and mitigation\n\nLLMs can [have biases](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-bias/) in their training data, which may lead to the spread of misinformation, representing one of the [risks associated with generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/risks-of-generative-ai/). A comprehensive evaluation framework helps identify and measure biases in LLM outputs, allowing researchers to develop strategies for bias detection and mitigation.\n\n### 4. User satisfaction and trust\n\nEvaluation of user satisfaction and trust is crucial to test generative language models. Relevance, coherence, and diversity are evaluated to ensure that models match user expectations and inspire trust. This assessment framework aids in understanding the level of user satisfaction and trust in the responses generated by the models.\n\n### 5. Evaluation of RAG systems\n\nLLM evaluation can be used to assess the quality of answers generated by [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://research.aimultiple.com/retrieval-augmented-generation/) systems. Various datasets can be utilized to verify the accuracy of the answers.\n\n## What are the common challenges with existing LLM evaluation methods?\n\nWhile existing evaluation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) provide valuable insights, they are imperfect. The common issues associated with them are:\n\n### Overfitting\n\nScale AI found that some LLMs are overfitting on popular AI benchmarks. They created GSM1k, a smaller version of the GSM8k benchmark for math testing. LLMs performed worse on GSM1k than on GSM8k, indicating a lack of genuine understanding. These findings suggest that current AI evaluation methods may be misleading due to overfitting, underscoring the need for additional testing methods, such as GSM1k.\n\n### Lack of diverse metrics\n\nThe evaluation techniques used for LLMs today frequently do not capture the whole range of output diversity and innovation. The crucial significance of producing diverse and creative replies is sometimes overlooked by traditional metrics emphasizing accuracy and relevance. Research on the problem of assessing diversity in LLM results is still ongoing. Although perplexity gauges a model’s ability to anticipate text, it ignores crucial elements like coherence, contextual awareness, and relevance. Therefore, depending only on ambiguity could not offer a thorough evaluation of an LLM’s actual quality.\n\n### Subjectivity & high cost of human evaluations\n\nHuman evaluation is a valuable method for assessing the outputs of large language models (LLMs). However, it can be subjective, biased, and significantly more expensive than automated evaluations. Different human evaluators may have varying opinions, and the criteria for evaluation may lack consistency. Furthermore, human evaluation can be time-consuming and costly, especially for large-scale assessments. Evaluators often disagree when assessing subjective aspects, such as helpfulness or creativity, making it challenging to establish a reliable ground truth for evaluation.\n\n### Biases in automated evaluations\n\nLLM evaluations suffer from predictable biases. We provided one example for each bias, but the opposite cases are also possible (e.g., some models can favor last items).\n\n* **Order bias**: First items favored.\n* **Compassion fade**: Names are favored vs. anonymized code words\n* **Ego bias**: Similar responses are favored\n* **Salience bias**: Longer responses are preferred\n* **Bandwagon effect**: Majority belief is preferred\n* **Attention bias**: Sharing more irrelevant information is preferred\n\n### Limited reference data\n\nSome evaluation methods, such as BLEU or ROUGE, require reference data for comparison.\xa0However, obtaining high-quality reference data can be challenging, especially when multiple acceptable responses exist or in open-ended tasks. Limited or biased reference data may not capture the full range of acceptable model outputs.\n\n### Generalization to real-world scenarios\n\nEvaluation methods typically focus on specific benchmark datasets or tasks that don’t fully reflect the challenges of real-world applications. The evaluation of controlled datasets may not generalize well to diverse and dynamic contexts where LLMs are deployed.\n\n### Adversarial attacks\n\nLLMs can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, such as manipulating model predictions and data poisoning, where carefully crafted input can mislead or deceive the model. Existing evaluation methods often do not account for such attacks, and robustness evaluation remains an active area of research.\n\nIn addition to these issues, [enterprise generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/enterprise-generative-ai/) models may struggle with [legal](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-legal/) and [ethical](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-ethics/) issues, which may affect LLMs in your business.\n\n### Complexity and cost of multi-dimensional evaluation\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) must be evaluated on various dimensions, such as factual accuracy, toxicity, and bias. This often involves trade-offs, making it challenging to develop unified scoring systems. A thorough evaluation of these models across multiple dimensions and datasets demands substantial computational resources, which can limit access for smaller organizations.\n\n## Best practices to overcome problems of LLM evaluation methods\n\nResearchers and practitioners are exploring various approaches and strategies to address the problems with large language models’ performance evaluation methods. It may be prohibitively expensive to leverage all of these approaches in every project, but awareness of these best practices can improve LLM project success.\n\n### Known training data\n\nLeverage foundation models that share their training data to prevent contamination.\n\n### Multiple evaluation metrics\n\nInstead of relying solely on perplexity, incorporate multiple evaluation metrics for a more comprehensive assessment of LLM performance. Metrics like\xa0these can better capture the different aspects of model quality:\n\n* Fluency\n* Coherence\n* Relevance\n* Diversity\n* Context understanding\n\n### Enhanced human evaluation\n\nClear guidelines and standardized criteria can improve the consistency and objectivity of human evaluation. Using multiple human judges and conducting inter-rater reliability checks can help reduce subjectivity. Additionally, crowd-sourcing evaluation can provide diverse perspectives and larger-scale assessments.\n\n### Diverse reference data\n\nCreate diverse and representative reference data to better evaluate LLM outputs. Curating datasets that cover a wide range of acceptable responses, encouraging contributions from diverse sources, and considering various contexts can enhance the quality and coverage of reference data.\n\n### Incorporating multiple metrics\n\nEncourage the generation of diverse responses and evaluate the uniqueness of generated text through methods such as n-gram diversity or semantic similarity measurements.\n\n### Real-world evaluation\n\n[Augmenting](https://research.aimultiple.com/data-augmentation-techniques/) evaluation methods with real-world scenarios and tasks can improve the generalization of LLM performance. Employing domain-specific or industry-specific evaluation datasets can provide a more realistic assessment of model capabilities.\n\n### Robustness evaluation\n\nEvaluating LLMs for robustness against adversarial attacks is an ongoing research area. Developing evaluation methods that test the model’s resilience to various adversarial inputs and scenarios can enhance the security and reliability of LLMs.\n\n### Leverage LLMOps\n\n[LLMOps](https://research.aimultiple.com/llmops-tools/), a specialized branch of [MLOps](https://research.aimultiple.com/mlops-tools/), is dedicated to developing and enhancing LLMs. Employing for testing and customizing LLMs in your business not only saves time but also minimizes errors.\n\n## Practical examples of LLM evaluation\n\nSeveral organizations have shared their practical experiences with LLM evaluation:\n\n## Ethical considerations in LLM evaluation\n\nWhile performance metrics and benchmarking are crucial, enterprises must also consider the [ethical](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-ethics/) implications of LLM evaluation. These include:\n\n* **Fairness:** Models may produce biased outputs that reflect systemic issues in their training data. Evaluation frameworks should measure bias across demographics, contexts, and applications.\n* **Transparency:** Clearly documenting datasets, evaluation criteria, and model limitations increases trust and accountability.\n* **Accountability:** Enterprises deploying LLMs must ensure that their evaluation processes align with relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in [healthcare](https://research.aimultiple.com/healthcare-ai/), [finance](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-finance/), and [government](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-government/) sectors.\n* **[Responsible](https://research.aimultiple.com/responsible-ai/) deployment:** Evaluations should measure not only accuracy but also social impact, safety, and misuse potential. This can include red-teaming and adversarial testing to expose risks.\n\nBy incorporating ethical considerations into evaluation frameworks, organizations can mitigate reputational risks, ensure compliance, and foster trust with users.\n\n## Latest trends in LLM evaluation\n\nResearch in LLM evaluation is evolving rapidly. Some notable trends include:\n\n* **Multimodal evaluation:** As models expand beyond text into images, audio, and video, evaluation frameworks are being extended to test multimodal understanding and generation.\n* **Dynamic benchmark creation:** Instead of static datasets that models may overfit, researchers are developing adaptive benchmarks that evolve (e.g., auto-generated, domain-specific test suites).\n* **LLM-as-a-judge 2.0:** Improved prompting strategies and chain-of-thought evaluations are enabling more reliable automated evaluations that better align with human judgments.\n* **Energy-aware benchmarking:** [Sustainability](https://research.aimultiple.com/sustainability-ai/)-focused benchmarks that evaluate carbon cost and energy efficiency are gaining traction.\n* **Red-teaming frameworks:** Systematic adversarial testing is becoming an integral part of evaluation pipelines, enabling the measurement of robustness against manipulation and unsafe behaviors.\n\n## What do leading researchers think about evals?\n\nTrust is eroding in evaluations that are no longer capable of accurately evaluating model performance:\n\n## Glossary of key terms\n\nFor readers new to the space, here’s a quick reference to essential evaluation metrics:\n\n* **Perplexity:** A measure of how well the model predicts text; lower is better.\n* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Measures overlap between machine translations and human translations.\n* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Compares machine-generated summaries against human-written references.\n* **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct outputs versus all outputs.\n* **Recall:** Ability to retrieve relevant results out of all possible correct ones.\n* **F1 score:** Harmonic mean of accuracy and recall.\n* **Coherence:** Logical flow and consistency of generated text.\n* **Diversity:** Uniqueness and variability of model outputs, often measured with n-grams or semantic similarity.\n* **Elo rating:** A competitive ranking system adapted from chess to compare models head-to-head.\n\n## 💡Conclusion\n\nEvaluating large language models is crucial throughout their entire lifecycle, encompassing selection, fine-tuning, and secure, dependable deployment. As the capabilities of LLMs increase, it becomes inadequate to depend solely on a single metric (like perplexity) or benchmark. Thus, a multidimensional strategy that integrates automated scores (e.g., BLEU/ROUGE, checks for factual consistency), structured human evaluations (with specific guidelines and inter-rater agreement), and custom tests for bias, fairness, and toxicity is vital to assess both quantitative performance and qualitative risks.\n\nYet significant challenges remain. Public benchmarks can lead to overfitting on well-trodden datasets, while human-in-the-loop evaluations are time-consuming and complicated to scale. Adversarial inputs expose robustness gaps, and energy-intensive models raise sustainability concerns. Addressing these requires curating diverse, domain-specific test suites; integrating red-team and adversarial stress-testing; deploying LLM-as-judge pipelines for rapid, cost-effective assessment; and tracking energy and inference costs alongside accuracy metrics.\n\nBy embedding these best practices within an LLMOps framework, organizations can maintain a robust, ongoing view of model behavior in production. This holistic evaluation strategy mitigates risks like bias, hallucination, and security vulnerabilities and ensures that LLMs deliver trustworthy, high-impact outcomes as they evolve.\n\n## FAQ\n\n## Further reading\n\nLearn more on ChatGPT to understand LLMs better by reading:\n\n* [AI Transformation: 6 Real-Life Strategies to Succeed](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-transformation/)\n* [ChatGPT Education Use Cases, Benefits & Challenges](https://research.aimultiple.com/chatgpt-education/)\n* [How to Use ChatGPT for Business: Top 40 Applications](https://research.aimultiple.com/chatgpt-for-business/)\n* [GPT-5: In-depth Guide](https://research.aimultiple.com/gpt-5/)\n\n## Reference Links\n\n[1.\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard - a Hugging Face Space by open-llm-leaderboard\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/)[2.\n\nGitHub - TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro: The code and data for "MMLU-Pro: A More Robust and Challenging Multi-Task Language Understanding Benchmark" [NeurIPS 2024]](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro)[3.\n\nGitHub - idavidrein/gpqa: GPQA: A Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark](https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa)[4.\n\nTAUR-Lab/MuSR · Datasets at Hugging Face\n\nTAUR Lab at UT Austin](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TAUR-Lab/MuSR)[5.\n\nGitHub - hendrycks/math: The MATH Dataset (NeurIPS 2021)](https://github.com/hendrycks/math)[6.\n\nlm-evaluation-harness/lm\\_eval/tasks/ifeval/README.md at main · EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness · GitHub](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/tasks/ifeval/README.md)[7.\n\nlukaemon/bbh · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukaemon/bbh)[8.\n\nGitHub - openai/human-eval: Code for the paper "Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code"](https://github.com/openai/human-eval)[9.\n\ndomenicrosati/TruthfulQA · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/domenicrosati/TruthfulQA)[10.\n\naps/super\\_glue · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue)[11.\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard - a Hugging Face Space by open-llm-leaderboard\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/)[12.\n\nIntroduction to Text Summarization with ROUGE Scores | Towards Data Science\n\nTowards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-text-summarization-with-rouge-scores-84140c64b471/)[13.\n\nGitHub - OpenLMLab/LEval: [ACL\'24 Outstanding] Data and code for L-Eval, a comprehensive long context language models evaluation benchmark](https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LEval)[14.\n\nprometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0 · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/prometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0)\n\nPrincipal Analyst\n\nCem Dilmegani\n\nPrincipal Analyst\n\n[Follow On](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cem-dilmegani/ "Follow on")\n\nCem has been the principal analyst at AIMultiple since 2017.

We’ll begin by looking at why evaluating LLMs is crucial, then discuss different ways metrics are commonly divided, and finally walk through each of the 15 metrics in detail.\n\n## **Why Evaluate Large Language Models?**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, powering everything from conversational agents to summarization systems. However, **not all generated text is equal**—some outputs may be more fluent, factually correct, diverse, or semantically coherent than others. Metrics are therefore critical to:\n\n* **Compare models**: Decide which model is best for a given use case.\n* **Track progress**: Measure improvements during model training or fine-tuning.\n* **Guide development**: Pinpoint weaknesses (e.g., factual errors, repetitiveness).\n\nBut evaluating LLMs is tricky. Language is **multi-dimensional**—it involves **correctness, coherence, style, factuality, diversity, and more**. No single metric captures all these aspects, so evaluation often involves **multiple metrics** plus **human judgment**.\n\nFor tasks involving classification, **evaluation metrics for classification** play a crucial role in assessing model performance. These metrics help ensure the reliability and accuracy of predictions, making them essential for LLM-powered applications.\n\n## **How Are These Metrics Divided?**\n\nBroadly, you can group LLM evaluation metrics into the following **categories**:\n\n1. **Language Modeling Metrics (Statistical)**  \n   * These measure **how well a model predicts text**, typically at the token or sequence level.\n   * Example: **Perplexity (PPL)**.\n2. **Lexical Overlap Metrics**  \n   * Compare **n-grams or word overlaps** between a generated text and a reference.\n   * Examples: **BLEU**, **ROUGE**, **METEOR**, **CIDEr**.\n3. **Embedding-Based Metrics**  \n   * Leverage **semantic embeddings** (e.g., from Transformers) to measure similarity rather than exact overlap.\n   * Examples: **BERTScore**, **MoverScore**.\n4. **Learned Metrics**  \n   * **Neural models** fine-tuned on human judgments to directly predict quality scores.\n   * Examples: **BLEURT**, **COMET**.\n5. **Diversity Metrics**   \n   * Track **repetitiveness or variety** in generated text.\n   * Examples: **Distinct-n**, **Self-BLEU**.\n6. **Task/Domain-Specific or Structural Metrics**  \n   * Designed to capture **factual consistency** or **semantic relations**.\n   * Examples: **Q²**, **SPICE**.\n7. **Human Evaluation**  \n   * The “gold standard” for evaluating **coherence, style, correctness**, and more nuanced aspects.\n\n## Understanding the Top 15 Metrics for LLM Evaluation\n\n### **1. Perplexity**\n\n**Perplexity (PPL)** is one of the oldest and most widely used statistical measures for **language modeling**. It gauges how well a model predicts or “perceives” the distribution of words in a given text.\n\n**1. How it’s calculated**\n\n**2. Why it’s important**\n\n* A lower perplexity indicates that the model’s predictions **better align with real text distributions**.\n\n**3. What it helps measure**\n\n* **Language fluency** and the model’s ability to accurately predict sequences of words.**\u200d**\n\n**4. Limitations**\n\n* Doesn’t always correlate with **downstream quality** or factual correctness.\n* A model can have low perplexity yet generate **repetitive or contextually irrelevant** text.\n\n### **2. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**\n\n**BLEU** was pioneered in the early 2000s for **machine translation** tasks. It has since become a **baseline** for many text generation tasks, thanks to its simplicity and general availability.\n\n**1. How it’s calculated**BLEU calculates **n-gram precision** between the generated text and reference(s). The overall score combines these precisions (commonly n=1 to 4) with a **brevity penalty** to discourage excessively short outputs:\n\n**2. Why it’s important**\n\n* Historically **dominant** in machine translation and many NLP benchmarks.\n* Provides a **quick, standardized** measure of lexical overlap.\n\n**3. What it helps measure**\n\n* **Lexical alignment**: How many of the **same n-grams** appear in the generated output versus references.\n\n**4. Limitations**\n\n* Penalizes **paraphrasing** or synonym use that doesn’t match the reference exactly.\n* Overly **surface-level**; can ignore semantic correctness.\n\n### **3. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**\n\n**ROUGE** is the go-to metric for **summarization**. It emphasizes **recall**—how much of the reference text appears in the generated summary.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * **ROUGE-N**: Measures **n-gram overlap**.\n   * **ROUGE-L**: Measures the **Longest Common Subsequence** (LCS).\n   * Other variants exist (e.g., ROUGE-W for weighted LCS).\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * **Quick and easy** to compute.\n   * Has **dominated summarization research** for years.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * The **coverage** of key elements from the reference (important for summarization).\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * Can **undervalue** concise or creative summaries that **don’t match** reference phrasing.\n   * Focus on **lexical overlap** rather than deeper semantic accuracy.\n\n### **4. METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)**\n\n**METEOR** was designed to **improve** upon BLEU by considering **synonyms, stemming,** and **word order**. It often **correlates better** with human judgments than BLEU in certain contexts.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * It uses a **F-measure** (precision and recall of unigrams) but also accounts for **synonym** and **morphological** matches.\n   * Adds a **fragmentation penalty** to reflect how well word order is preserved.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * Gives **partial credit** for words that are similar (synonyms/stems) rather than requiring exact matches.\n   * Often more **fine-grained** than BLEU.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * **Lexical choice** and **word order**, with some tolerance for paraphrasing.\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * Still largely **surface-level** and reliant on **specific resources** (e.g., WordNet for synonyms).\n   * May miss more **complex paraphrasing** structures.\n\n### **5. CIDEr (Consensus-based Image Description Evaluation)**\n\nOriginally proposed for **image captioning**, **CIDEr** extends n-gram matching but weights words via **TF-IDF** to prioritize **informative** words.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * Each sentence is converted into a vector of **TF-IDF** weights for n-grams.\n   * A cosine similarity is then computed between the candidate and reference vectors.\n2. **Why it’s important**   \n   * **Discounts** common filler words and **rewards** more specific terms that carry content.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * The **relevance** and **informativeness** of generated text based on **key content words**.\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * **Heavily reference-dependent** and can still penalize valid paraphrases.\n   * Designed with **image captioning** in mind; might not generalize perfectly to all text generation scenarios.\n\n### **6. BERTScore**\n\n**BERTScore** is an **embedding-based** metric that leverages **pre-trained Transformer** models to measure **token-level similarity** between reference and candidate texts.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * Both candidate and reference tokens are converted into **contextual embeddings** (e.g., BERT).\n   * A pairwise **cosine similarity** matrix is computed, and an **optimal matching** scheme finds precision and recall.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * Goes beyond exact word matching by capturing **semantic similarity**.\n   * Often correlates **better with human judgments** than purely lexical metrics.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * **Semantic alignment**: how meaningfully close the candidate is to the reference.\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * Dependent on the **quality of the underlying pre-trained model**.\n   * Still requires a **reference** text; not a direct measure of factual accuracy.\n\n### **7. MoverScore**\n\n**MoverScore** evolves from **Word Mover’s Distance**, using **contextual embeddings** to measure the “distance” between candidate and reference sentences.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * It computes the **minimum cost** to “move” tokens in the candidate to match tokens in the reference, leveraging **BERT (or similar) embeddings**.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * **Order-invariant** to some extent, capturing **semantic overlap** without strict n-gram alignment.\n   * Tends to **handle paraphrases** well.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * The **semantic similarity** between candidate and reference, factoring in **embeddings** rather than raw tokens.\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * More **computationally expensive** than simpler metrics.\n   * **Reference-dependent** and may still not capture deeper factual correctness.\n\n### **8. BLEURT**\n\n**BLEURT** is a **learned metric** that uses a **pre-trained Transformer** model, further **fine-tuned** on **human-labeled** quality assessments to predict a numeric score.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * A reference and candidate are fed into the **BLEURT** model, which outputs a **quality score**.\n   * Training data often includes **synthetic perturbations** of sentences and **human judgments**.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * **Incorporates human judgments** directly into the training objective.\n   * Can capture **nuanced errors** that purely lexical or embedding-based metrics may miss.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * Overall **text quality and fluency**, grounded in **human notions** of correctness.\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * Requires **robust training data** for the domain of interest.\n   * Performance can degrade if **domain or style** is very different from the training set.\n\n### **9. COMET**\n\n**COMET** (Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation) is another **learned metric** specifically designed for **machine translation**. It’s **trained** on **source, reference, and candidate** triplets with **human-annotated scores**.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * A **Transformer** model processes **source, candidate,** and **reference**, producing a **quality score**.\n   * Fine-tuned on **human judgments** from translation data.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * Often **outperforms** lexical metrics in **machine translation** tasks.\n   * Accounts for **cross-lingual semantics** by involving the source text.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * **Translation quality** in terms of **fluency, adequacy,** and **faithfulness** to the source.\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * Primarily **trained for translation** tasks; might not generalize to all text generation tasks.\n   * Subject to **domain mismatch** issues if the target text is very different from training data.\n\n### **10. Distinct-n**\n\n**Distinct-n** was introduced to measure the **diversity** of generated text—important in dialogues and creative content generation where repetition is undesirable.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * **Distinct-n** = (Number of unique n-grams) / (Total n-grams in the generated text).\n   * Typically, Distinct-1 counts unique unigrams, Distinct-2 counts unique bigrams, and so on.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * **Penalizes repetitiveness**, pushing the model to generate more varied text.\n   * Useful for detecting “generic” or **templated** responses.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * The **lexical diversity** of outputs, indicating if the model is repeating words/phrases excessively.\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * A model could have high Distinct-n but still be **incoherent or off-topic**.\n   * Doesn’t capture **semantic** or **factual** correctness.\n\n### **11. F1 Score**\n\nWhile the **F1** metric is traditionally used in **classification**, it can be adapted for **extraction tasks** (e.g., QA systems that return spans of text). It balances **precision** and **recall**.\n\n**1. How it’s calculated**\n\n**2. Why it’s important**\n\n* Weighs **correctness** (precision) and **completeness** (recall) equally.\n* Simple and interpretable for **correct/incorrect** tasks.\n\n**3. What it helps measure**\n\n* The ability of the model to **retrieve** or **identify** the right tokens or answers.\n\n**4. Limitations**\n\n* Assumes a **binary** notion of correctness.\n* Doesn’t evaluate **semantic nuance** or partial correctness.\n\n### **12. Self-BLEU**\n\n**Self-BLEU** measures the **similarity among** multiple generated outputs from the **same model**—effectively quantifying **intra-model diversity**.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * For each generated sample, treat it as a “candidate” and the **rest** of the samples as “references,” then compute BLEU.\n   * The final score is typically an average.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * **Lower Self-BLEU** = **higher diversity**.\n   * Helps detect models that produce **repetitive** or **generic** outputs.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * **Variety** of language generation across multiple samples.\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * **Doesn’t** directly evaluate correctness, coherence, or factualness.\n   * If a model has many **paraphrased** but semantically similar outputs, Self-BLEU might still rate them as too “similar.”\n\n### **13. Q² (Quality & Qualitative for Consistency)**\n\n**Q²** is designed for **factual consistency** and **coherence**. It uses a **question generation and question answering** approach to verify the correctness of generated text.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * A separate system **generates questions** from the generated text.\n   * Another system **answers** those questions based on the source or reference text.\n   * The answers are **compared**; high consistency indicates factual alignment.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * Specifically targets the **factual accuracy** of summaries or outputs—crucial in **high-stakes** content (news, medical).\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * **Correctness** of information, focusing on whether the text actually conveys facts consistent with a reference or source.\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * Relies on the **quality of question generation** and **QA models**; any error there can skew results.\n   * Primarily relevant to **tasks with a verifiable source** (e.g., summarization).\n\n### **14. SPICE (Semantic Propositional Image Caption Evaluation)**\n\n**SPICE** was introduced for **image captioning**, focusing on **semantic propositional content** by building **scene graphs** for candidate and reference captions.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**   \n   * Candidate and reference texts are **parsed** into scene-graph tuples (objects, attributes, relations).\n   * Computes an **F-score** over these tuples.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * Goes beyond **surface-level** n-grams to capture **relations** among entities.\n   * Useful where **structural or relational correctness** matters.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * **Semantic structure** alignment—are the same objects and relations present in the candidate?\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * Requires a **robust semantic parser** which can introduce errors.\n   * **Limited** to tasks where scene-graph-like structures are meaningful.\n\n### **15. Human Evaluation**\n\nDespite the proliferation of automated metrics, **human evaluation** remains the **gold standard**. Humans can judge **coherence, fluency, factual correctness, style,** and other subtle language features that automated metrics often miss.\n\n1. **How it’s calculated**  \n   * Human annotators read or compare outputs.\n   * They might **score** them on dimensions (fluency, coherence, factual accuracy) or **rank** different model outputs.\n2. **Why it’s important**  \n   * Captures **nuances** no automated metric can fully capture.\n   * Reflects **real-world user satisfaction**.\n3. **What it helps measure**  \n   * **Overall quality** and **usability** of the text, including intangible aspects (tone, creativity, etc.).\n4. **Limitations**  \n   * **Time-consuming** and can be **expensive** at scale.\n   * **Subjective**; requires **careful guidelines** and multiple annotators to ensure reliability.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nEvaluating LLMs is **multi-faceted**:\n\n* **Language modeling metrics** like perplexity help gauge **statistical fluency**.\n* **Lexical overlap metrics** (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr) are useful for tasks with well-defined references.\n* **Embedding-based metrics** (BERTScore, MoverScore) and **learned metrics** (BLEURT, COMET) step up by capturing **semantics**.\n* **Diversity metrics** (Distinct-n, Self-BLEU) ensure outputs aren’t repetitive or generic.\n* **Factual-consistency** or **semantic-structure** metrics (Q², SPICE) help verify correct information is conveyed.\n* **Human evaluation** remains **irreplaceable** for capturing **subjective qualities**.\n\nNo single metric is perfect. Practitioners often combine multiple automated scores with human evaluation for a complete picture. The key is choosing metrics that align with your task (e.g., factual vs. creative tasks) and validating them through human assessments whenever possible.\n\n### Share this post\n\n[Gen AI](/blog-tags/gen-ai)\n\n### Table of contents\n\n[Text Link](#)\n\n### Low-Code AI Automation Starts Here – Try Arya Apex\n\nAccess 100+ plug & play AI APIs to streamline manual tasks and improve productivity.

[Why LLM Benchmarks Are More Than Just Numbers](javascript:void(0);)\n\nCopied!\n\nQuick Takeaways\n\n*This blog explains what exactly LLM benchmarks are, why they are essential, and how they help to evaluate models across tasks like reasoning, coding, and safety. The blog also covers key benchmark types, common examples, their limitations, and how to choose the right one for your use case. You will also get a glimpse into the future of benchmarking with real-world testing and community feedback.*\n\nIn **2023**, over **150 new LLMs** were released, each promising to be faster, smarter, and more aligned than others. However, the major question is how we actually measure their performance. It is exactly like hiring an employee without checking their qualifications or past work. Deploying [AI models](https://www.openxcell.com/blog/ai-model-training/) without measuring LLM benchmarks easily puts the business at risk.\n\nAs LLMs rapidly change industries and power everything from customer support to medical insights, the need for standardized evaluation is more important than ever. In this blog, we’ll break down what LLM benchmarks are, why they matter, and how they can help you make smarter choices, especially if you are exploring [AI development services](https://www.openxcell.com/ai-development-services/) or choosing between leading models.\n\n## What Are LLM Benchmarks?\n\nLLM benchmarks are standardized frameworks designed to evaluate the performance of large language models across various tasks and domains. These benchmarks utilize the given datasets and carefully structured tasks to assess the LLM’s capabilities in various tasks like understanding language, coding, reasoning, and more.\n\nBy highlighting the strengths and uncovering limitations, benchmarks provide transparency and a consistent way to measure and compare model performance.\n\nIn the expanding world of [LLM development](https://www.openxcell.com/llm-development/), benchmarking plays a vital role in making sure that models perform amazingly and also align with the expectations of real-world apps.\n\nAdditionally, benchmarking helps to identify the more suitable models for particular use cases and drives the development of more adaptable, reliable, and intelligent systems.\n\nTo give a comprehensive evaluation, LLMs are mainly assessed on these four key dimensions.\n\n**1. Accuracy**\n\nMeasures how closely a model’s outputs align with ground truth or expected answers. This includes factual correctness, relevance, and task-specific success rates. The accuracy is typically evaluated using datasets with known answers and metrics like recall and precision.\n\n**2. Reasoning**\n\nThis evaluates the model’s logical thinking, inferencing capabilities, and problem-solving. The reasoning follows multi-step instructions, pattern recognition, and making sound judgments under ambiguity.\n\n**3. Bias**\n\nIt assesses the model’s tendency to generate skewed or unfair content that favors particular groups or ideologies. Evaluating bias involves analyzing outputs across different demographics using specialized diagnostic tools.\n\n**4. Safety**\n\nThe safety ensures that the model avoids making harmful, offensive, or risky content. The safety assessments focus on how well the model can refuse unsafe prompts and handle the sensitive topic responsibly.\n\nBy measuring these dimensions, the LLM benchmarks provide the foundation for building AI systems that are not only powerful but also trustworthy, fair, and safe for widespread adoption.\n\n## Why LLM Benchmarks Matter\n\nAs LLM is becoming integral for products and services in different industries, evaluating its performance goes beyond curiosity; it is a necessity. It improved user experiences to ensure responsible AI behavior, and LLM benchmarking plays an important role in shaping how these models are used and built.\n\n1. **Guaranteeing Model Reliability**\n\nBenchmarking validates the models, such as whether the LLM is consistently producing relevant, accurate, and safe responses in different situations. Without these reliable benchmarks, it is hard to trust the models that will behave predictably when deployed in real-world apps.\n\n1. **Guiding Model Development and Deployment**\n\nDuring training and [LLM fine-tuning](https://www.openxcell.com/llm-fine-tuning/), benchmarks work as checkpoints to measure progress and identify areas for improvement. It also helps determine when a model is ready for production, guaranteeing that only capable and strong models reach end users.\n\n1. **Comparing Model Capabilities Objectively**\n\nAs there are multiple LLMs available in the market, benchmarks give a fair and data-driven way to compare them. This empowers developers, researchers, and businesses to choose appropriate models for particular use cases based on measurable performance rather than just hype.\n\nBy grounding these decisions in benchmark data, teams can confidently build, improve, and deploy LLMs that deliver value.\n\n## Key Types of LLM Benchmarks\n\nLLMs are made to perform a wide range of tasks like answering trivia, solving math problems, writing, analyzing images, and more. Different categories of LLM benchmarks have been developed to evaluate these different capabilities.\n\nEach type of benchmark targets specific types of skills to make sure that models are tested across various spectrums of real-world requirements.\n\nBelow are the main categories of LLM benchmark types, along with their popular examples.\n\n### 1. Knowledge & Reasoning Benchmarks\n\nThese benchmarks evaluate how well models understand factual knowledge and apply it to logical reasoning.\n\n* **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):** Tests models across 57 academic subjects.\n* **TruthfulQA:** Focuses on whether a model provides factually correct and honest answers to tricky questions.\n* **ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge):** Measures a model’s grade-school level reasoning capabilities.\n* **HellaSwag:** Assesses commonsense reasoning by asking models to complete sentence sequences.\n\n### 2. Multimodal Benchmarks\n\nThese are designed for models to process both text and images.\n\n* **MMMU (Massive Multimodal Multitask Understanding):** A broad benchmark that tests general knowledge and perception tasks.\n* **VQAv2 (Visual Question Answering):** Evaluates a model’s ability to answer questions based on images.\n\n### 3. Code Understanding & Generation Benchmarks\n\nThese are specialized LLM coding benchmarks that test a model’s programming skills.\n\n* **HumanEval:** Requires models to write functioning code based on problem descriptions.\n* **MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Problems):** Focuses on smaller coding tasks with specific input/output requirements.\n\n### 4. Bias, Fairness & Safety Benchmarks\n\nThis category ensures that the model gives a harmful product, is biased, or has offensive content.\n\n* **BBQ (Bias Benchmark for QA):** Tests for social bias in question-answering tasks.\n* **WinoBias:** Measures gender bias in pronoun resolution.\n* **RealToxicityPrompts:** Evaluate how often models generate or amplify toxic language.\n\n### 5. Instruction Following / Alignment Benchmarks\n\nThese test how well models follow user prompts or align with human intent.\n\n* **AlpacaEval:** Measures model performance on instruction-following tasks.\n* **MT-Bench:** Evaluates conversational abilities and alignment through multi-turn dialogue tasks.\n\nEach LLM benchmark plays a crucial role in pushing models toward greater usability, safety, and intelligence. By utilizing the right benchmarks, developers can create more targeted, ethical, and effective LLMs ready for real-world deployment.\n\n******A Must Read:** [**LLM Security: Protecting AI Models from Attacks & Data Leaks**](https://www.openxcell.com/blog/llm-security/)****\n\n## Widely Used LLM Benchmarks and What They Evaluate\n\nAs there are dozens of LLM benchmarks are available, only a few have emerged as per the industry standards for evaluating core model capabilities. Here are some of the most commonly used LLM model benchmarks to help developers understand a model’s strengths in depth, with its reasoning, accuracy, and generation.\n\n* **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):**\n\nIt tests the model’s ability to handle questions from 57 academic and professional subjects, reflecting its general knowledge and task diversity.\n\n* **HellaSwag:**\n\nThis measures commonsense reasoning by asking the model to choose the most plausible sentence to complete a scenario.\n\n* **TruthfulQA:**\n\nIt evaluates how accurately a model responds to tricky or misleading questions, revealing its susceptibility to generating falsehoods.\n\n* **GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K):**\n\nGSM8K particularly focuses on math word problems to test its multi-step logical reasoning and arithmetic skills.\n\n* **HumanEval:**\n\nAssesses code generation quality by questioning the model to write different functions based on natural language prompts, with correctness validated through test cases.\n\nThese benchmarks give critical insights into when an LLM excels or falls short. These benchmarks aren’t just regular academic tools. They are used in real-world implications.\n\n***For instance, Openxcell’s*** [***Smart AI Healthcare App***](https://www.openxcell.com/our-work/smart-ai-health-app/) ***uses LLMs to provide intelligent health insights, which requires a careful evaluation of the model’s reasoning and factual accuracy.

As businesses and consumers demand more from generative AI, benchmarks will need to evolve to assess models' abilities to meet these expectations. Evaluating models on new and emerging tasks, incorporating user feedback into benchmarking processes, and ensuring that models are aligned with ethical standards and societal values are crucial. By staying responsive to these changes, companies using LLM benchmarking can support the development of language models that drive innovation and deliver value across a wide range of applications.\n\n## LLM benchmarking FAQs\n\n### What’s the purpose of LLM evaluation and benchmarking?\n\nLLM evaluation and benchmarking are used to systematically assess the capabilities and performance of large language models across various dimensions, including accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and more. This process is vital for understanding a model's strengths and weaknesses, recognizing and addressing its biases, guiding the development of more advanced models, and ensuring that the models deployed in business applications meet the required standards for quality and performance.\n\n### What are some common benchmarks used in LLM evaluation?\n\nCommon benchmarks in LLM evaluation include tasks designed to test a model's understanding of language, reasoning ability, and generation capabilities. These can range from simple text completion and question-answering tasks to more complex challenges like machine translation (MT Bench), coding benchmarks, and tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Additionally, benchmarks may assess model performance in terms of latency, throughput, and the ability to handle concurrent users.\n\n### How do you evaluate LLM performance?\n\nEvaluating an LLM's performance involves running the model through a series of standardized tasks or benchmarks and measuring its performance based on predefined metrics. These metrics can include accuracy, the number of output tokens generated correctly, inference speed, and the model's ability to scale across different tasks and datasets. The evaluation process should also consider the model's efficiency in terms of resource utilization and its ability to optimize inference for faster, more accurate responses.\n\n## Get faster ROI from generative AI with open-source LLMs\n\nWith Bring Your Own LLM (BYO-LLM) through Teradata's ClearScape Analytics™, you can deploy cost-effective open-source large language models for valuable generative AI use cases.

While I immediately understand the importance of model openness (something I’m adamant about), I still need to get a clearer picture of what the benchmarks actually measure and how to interpret their results.\n\nI figured if I’m trying to make sense of these benchmarks, maybe others are too. Let me share what I’ve learned so far about the LLM benchmarking landscape and why, ultimately, openness might matter more than any performance score.\n\nWhy do you care, Jason? Well, this matters because choosing an LLM is effectively selecting the “brain” that powers our AI agencies. We need these models to be functional, cost-effective, and above all, trustworthy.\n\n![]()\n\n## What The Benchmark Tests Actually Measure\n\nWhen you look at any LLM leaderboard, you’ll see a variety of acronyms and scores. Here’s what I’ve figured out about what each test actually evaluates:\n\n## **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**\n\nThis is basically a comprehensive multiple-choice exam spanning 57 subjects from elementary mathematics to professional medicine and law. A score of 90% means the model correctly answered 9 out of 10 questions across these diverse domains.\n\nNow MMLU tests a breadth of knowledge rather than depth in any specific area. It gives us a good sense of a model’s general knowledge but doesn’t tell us how deeply it understands any particular domain. Feels like the California Achievement Test to me.\n\nThis breadth-over-depth approach makes sense when you consider that most implementations will involve fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge anyway, making general knowledge depth less critical from the outset. Again, a college freshman yet to declare a major.\n\n## **HumanEval**\n\nThis benchmark focuses purely on coding ability. It presents the model with function descriptions and checks whether the generated code actually works by running it against test cases. A score of 70% means the model wrote functioning code for 70% of the programming challenges. Simply put, this is how well they can write code.\n\nHowever, this test only evaluates whether the code works, not its efficiency, readability, or security — factors that matter tremendously in real-world development.\n\n## **GSM8K**\n\nThis focuses specifically on grade-school math word problems requiring multi-step reasoning. It tests whether models can break down problems logically and solve them step-by-step.\n\nWhat’s interesting here is that the score represents raw accuracy but doesn’t differentiate between different types of errors — a complete misunderstanding versus a minor calculation mistake counts exactly the same.\n\n## **TruthfulQA**\n\nThis measures how often models give accurate versus inaccurate information, specifically targeting areas where AI systems might repeat common misconceptions.\n\nThis hits home–this directly tests a model’s tendency toward hallucination — a critical factor for trustworthy AI applications. The hallucination metrics from this test are particularly interesting and I wonder if this ties to the alignment-faking behaviors I explored in my previous research.\n\n## **BIG-Bench**\n\nThis massive collection of 204 diverse tasks evaluates everything from logical reasoning to social understanding. It’s like a decathlon for AI models. The aggregate scores can mask significant variation across individual tasks. A model might excel at logical reasoning but struggle with cultural nuance.\n\n![]()\n\n## How to Interpret Benchmark Scores\n\nWhen I’m comparing models on leaderboards, I try to keep these considerations in mind:\n\n**Relative Performance.** When GPT-4 scores 86.4% on MMLU while Llama 2 scores 68.9%, that represents a wide capability gap. However, the difference between 86% and 88% may not mean much in practice.\n\n**Context Matters.** On many benchmarks, human experts score around 90%. So as models approach this range, small differences become much less significant.\n\n**Benchmark Design Influence.** Models can be specifically optimized for popular benchmarks without necessarily improving on real-world tasks — similar to teaching to the test.\n\n**Performance Distribution.** Average scores hide variation. A model with 85% average accuracy might fail completely on certain problem types while excelling at others. Again, a C student across all subjects illustrates this.\n\n**Temporal Context.** Benchmarks represent a point-in-time assessment. Models evolve through updates, and a benchmark from six months ago might not reflect current capabilities.\n\nFor example, when I see Claude 3 Opus scoring 90.5% on MMLU versus GPT-4’s 86.4%, I now interpret this as both models demonstrating strong general knowledge capabilities, with Claude showing a slight edge in this particular test format — this isn’t necessarily an indicator of superior performance across all possible tasks.\n\n## The Value of the Performance Leaderboard\n\nThe [Hugging Face LLM Performance Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ArtificialAnalysis/LLM-Performance-Leaderboard) provides a helpful aggregation of various benchmark results in one place. I’ve found it valuable as:\n\nJust remember, leaderboards don’t capture:\n\nI view leaderboards as a single input in my evaluation process, not as the definitive ranking of which model is absolutely the “best.”\n\n![]()\n\n## Why Openness Trumps Performance Numbers\n\nThe aspect of LLM evaluation that has become increasingly clear to me is the paramount importance of model openness. The Linux Foundation’s [Model Openness Framework](https://lfaidata.foundation/blog/2024/04/17/introducing-the-model-openness-framework-promoting-completeness-and-openness-for-reproducibility-transparency-and-usability-in-ai/) offers a structured way to assess this, evaluating seven dimensions:\n\nThe framework categorizes models into four levels of openness:\n\nHere’s why I’ve come to value openness over benchmark scores:\n\n**Adaptability.** Open models can be fine-tuned for specific domains, potentially achieving better results than a higher-scoring but closed model.\n\n**Verification.** With open models, claims about performance and capabilities can be independently verified rather than taken on faith.\n\n**Understanding.** Transparency provides insights into how the model works, its strengths, and its limitations.\n\n**Longevity.** Open models aren’t dependent on a single company’s business decisions. If a provider changes direction, the model can still be maintained by the community.\n\n**Collaborative Improvement.** Open models benefit from the collective expertise of the entire field, often advancing more rapidly than closed alternatives.\n\n## My Practical Evaluation Approach\n\nBased on what I’ve learned, here’s how I approach LLM evaluation:\n\nThis approach has led me to prefer “lower-ranked” but more open models for certain projects, with better long-term results than simply going with the benchmark leaders.\n\n## What I’m Exploring Next\n\nAs my understanding clears on this topic, here are the areas I’m most interested in exploring:\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nBenchmark scores provide useful data points about model capabilities, but they’re just the beginning of proper evaluation. Understanding what these tests actually measure helps interpret their results more accurately.\n\nWhile performance metrics grab headlines, model openness often proves more valuable in practice — especially for mission-critical applications where adaptability, verification, and control matter.\n\nWhen evaluating models for your projects, look beyond the leaderboard rankings. Consider what specific capabilities you need, how you’ll verify performance in your domain, and how much transparency and control you require. The right model might not be the one with the highest benchmark scores, but the one that best fits your specific needs and openness requirements.\n\n## About the Author\n\nJason T.

As LLMs run many AI applications and technologies, such as AI copilots, AI Agnets, and speech recognition technologies, evaluation of LLM performance, accuracy, and efficiency is key. In this article, we will provide technical details on how LLMs are evaluated.\n\nA thorough evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial to measure their effectiveness and ensure these advanced systems meet the high bar for their many LLM use cases. To do this precise LLM evaluation metrics are needed.\n\n## What is LLM Evaluation?\n\nLLM evaluation is a complex process to assess the capabilities and functionalities of large language models. The evaluation framework helps you identify strengths and weaknesses so you can refine models and pick the best one for your project needs. Let’s start with a quick but thorough overview of LLM accuracy.\n\nThe core of LLM evaluation is to get beyond output analysis and into the model’s guts. This isn’t just about what the model says, but how it got there. For example, an LLM might give a factually correct answer, but an effective evaluation checks if the answer is based on the source material (if it’s a RAG system) or if it’s a confident hallucination. This is a key distinction between surface-level analysis and deep technical evaluation. For any enterprise, this level of scrutiny is critical for building trustworthy AI applications.\n\n### Importance of LLM Accuracy\n\nIn the current landscape, large language models are being applied to many sectors. This includes the integration of [large language models in healthcare](https://aisera.com/blog/large-language-models-healthcare/), a pivotal development that is reshaping the industry. Also, LLMs are being employed in banking and AI customer service to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. So it’s important to regularly evaluate these models to ensure their accuracy and reliability to produce valid responses, avoid [AI mistakes](https://aisera.com/blog/ai-mistakes/), and reduce [AI hallucinations](https://aisera.com/blog/ai-hallucination/).\n\nThe core of LLM performance evaluation is to understand the effectiveness of the [foundation models](https://aisera.com/blog/foundation-models/). This is done by testing against evaluation datasets, which are designed to push the limits of an LLM or model’s performance, accuracy, fluency, and relevance. This deep analysis shows how the model processes and generates language for applications from question answering to content creation.\n\nMoving to system evaluation, we look at specific components within the LLM framework such as prompts and contexts which are crucial for real world application of these models. Tools like OpenAI’s Eval library and open source libraries such as [Hugging Face’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugging_Face) platforms provide valuable resources to evaluate the foundation models. These tools not only enable comparison but also give developers the empirical evidence to [fine-tune LLMs](https://aisera.com/blog/fine-tuning-llms/) for their use cases.\n\n## What LLM Evaluation Metrics Are?\n\nRecognizing the diversity of applications that modern large language models serve, it becomes evident that a one-size-fits-all approach to LLM performance evaluation is impractical. Rather, the large language model evaluation process must adapt to the intricacies of various use cases, employing tailored LLM evaluation metrics that accurately reflect the unique demands of each scenario.\n\n### Context-Specific Evaluation\n\nWhen deploying LLMs in education, for instance, developers meticulously examine the age-appropriateness of the model’s responses, as well as their propensity to avoid toxic outputs. Similarly, consumer-facing applications may prioritize response relevance and the capacity of a model to sustain coherent and engaging interactions. All these evaluation points are influenced significantly by the selection and structuring of the LLM prompts and contexts.\n\n* **Relevance**: Does the LLM provide information pertinent to the user’s query?\n* **Hallucination**: Is the model prone to generating factually incorrect or illogical statements? Is the model prone to generating factually incorrect or illogical statements? What improvements can be made to reduce [AI hallucinations](https://aisera.com/blog/ai-hallucination/)?\n* **Question-answering accuracy**: How effectively can the LLM handle direct user inquiries?\n* **Toxicity**: Are the model outputs clear of offensive or harmful content?\n* **Bleu score**: The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score measures the similarity between a machine-generated text and a reference human translation. It evaluates how closely the machine output matches the human reference, often used in translation tasks.\n* **Rouge score**: The ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score is a set of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translations. It focuses on recall, assessing how much of the reference content is captured in the generated summary or translation.\n\n### Advanced Evaluation Techniques\n\nEncapsulated in tools like the Phoenix evaluation framework, these considerations form the bedrock of a robust evaluation system, emphasizing the significance of contextual relevance in the dynamic between question and reference texts.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LLM Evaluation Metric | Relevance to Use Case | Tools for Measurement |\n| Age Appropriateness | Essential for educational content aimed at children | Content filtering algorithms, manual expert reviews |\n| Response Relevance | Crucial for customer service bots and information retrieval systems | Relevance scoring based on user interaction data |\n| Accuracy in Question-Answering | Key in research, analytical tasks, and educational applications | Automated QA testing, human evaluation, community feedback |\n| Minimization of Toxicity | Vital for all public-facing applications | Toxicity detection software, sentiment analysis tools |\n\n### User Experience Metrics\n\nBeyond these primary metrics, evaluating the overall user experience is crucial. This involves assessing how intuitive and user-friendly the LLM is, which includes:\n\n* **Response Time**: How quickly does the LLM generate responses?\n* **User Satisfaction**: Are users satisfied with the interactions? This can be measured through feedback and engagement metrics.\n* **Error Recovery**: How well does the LLM handle errors or misunderstandings? Effective error recovery mechanisms enhance user trust and reliability.\n\nGuided by specific use cases, LLM system evaluation transcends mere number-crunching. It is an exercise in understanding the nuanced requirements of various applications, thereby shaping a more inclusive and responsible approach to AI development and implementation.\n\n## The Rise of LLM Evaluation for AI Agents\n\nThe move from large language models to AI Agents has added a new layer of complexity to evaluation. A standard LLM is a text generator, an AI Agent is an autonomous system that plans, reasons and executes multi-step tasks to achieve a goal. Evaluating these agents goes beyond fluency or relevance. It requires a framework that can assess their end-to-end performance in a real-world, dynamic environment.\n\nFor example, a traditional LLM might be evaluated on how well it answers a single question. An AI Agent to book a flight needs to be evaluated on its ability to perform a series of actions: search for flights, select the best option, fill out a form and confirm.\n\nThis is where frameworks like Aisera’s **CLASSic Framework** come into play. It moves the focus from model metrics to practical, real-world performance indicators of an AI Agent. The framework’s emphasis on **Cost**, **Latency**, **Accuracy**, **Stability**, and **Security** provides a holistic, data-driven way to measure an agent’s effectiveness. These metrics measure the entire task, not just a single output, which is critical for enterprise applications where an agent’s failure to complete a task can have business consequences. This shift in focus is the key differentiator in the modern LLM evaluation landscape.\n\n## How to Evaluate LLMs?\n\nHow to evaluate LLMs is as much about refining the algorithms underneath as it is about the final integration in a specific context to be seamless and productive. Choosing the right model is key as it’s the foundation upon which businesses and developers can build innovative and reliable solutions that meet user requirements in this ever-changing tech landscape.\n\n### LLM Evaluation Framework\n\nAs we get deeper into artificial intelligence, [Agentic AI](https://aisera.com/blog/agentic-ai/) systems and large language models are having more and more impact across industries. After [LLM security](https://aisera.com/blog/llm-security/) concerns have been addressed, the focus shifts to ensuring these models perform reliably across various tasks and domains. To understand why evaluating LLMs is so important, we need to think about the breadth of applications for LLMs and how that is outpacing traditional feedback mechanisms to monitor their performance. The LLM evaluation process is necessary for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, it provides a window into the model’s reliability and speed – the two key factors that determine how an AI will perform in the real world. Without a robust and current evaluation method, you will have inaccuracies and inefficiencies going unchecked, which will lead to poor user experience. Evaluating LLMs gives businesses and practitioners the insights to tune these models so they are properly calibrated to serve the AI and the specific needs of their deployments.\n\n### CLASSic Framework\n\nThe CLASSic Framework is designed to provide a holistic and actionable view of an AI agent’s performance, moving beyond raw language metrics to measure the full lifecycle of a task. It recognizes that in a live enterprise environment, a model’s value is determined by its total cost of ownership and its ability to operate securely and reliably under pressure.\n\nThis comprehensive approach is what enables businesses to confidently scale their AI initiatives, knowing their agents are not just “smart” but are also efficient, stable, and secure.\n\n* **Cost** is the operational expense of the agent, including API usage, tokens, and infrastructure.\n* **Latency** is the end to end response time, how fast the task gets executed.\n* **Accuracy** is the precision of workflow selection and execution.\n* **Stability** is the robustness of the model across different inputs, domains and operational conditions.\n* **Security** is the resistance to adversarial inputs, prompt injection and data leaks. This framework provides a data driven way to optimize AI agent performance in real world enterprise use cases.\n\n## Model Evaluation Templates\n\nYou can choose a variety of prompt templates for evaluating your fine-tuned large language model using the LLM Eval module.\n\n### 1- General\n\nThe General template provides a standardized framework for evaluating language models and comparing fine-tuned model responses to reference scores. It utilizes common NLP metrics to assess the overall performance and accuracy of the generated outputs.\n\n### 2- TruthfulQA\n\nThe [TruthfulQA](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) template assesses a model’s performance based on the TruthfulQA benchmark, which evaluates how models avoid generating false responses. It ensures models generate truthful answers, avoiding human-like falsehoods, and uses zero-shot generative tasks to measure response quality.\n\n### 3- LLM-as-a-Judge\n\nThe [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) template uses a strong LLM to evaluate the outputs of another LLM, leveraging AI to assess the quality of responses. The model acts as a judge, comparing predicted outputs against ideal responses, and scores them using methods like LangChain’s CriteriaEvalChain.\n\n## Applications of LLM Evaluation\n\nThe rigorous assessment of LLMs is more than an academic exercise; it is a business imperative in a data-driven world. Measuring the capabilities and limitations of LLMs with precise evaluation metrics enables us to harness their full potential, optimize their application in diverse fields, and ensure they serve our objectives effectively.\n\n### Performance Assessment\n\nIn assessing the performance of LLMs, a range of metrics is utilized to understand how effectively these models interpret human language and provide accurate responses. This covers tests to evaluate comprehension, information extraction, and the quality of generated text in response to varying input conditions.\n\n#### Ground Truth Evaluation\n\nGround truth evaluation is a critical aspect of performance assessment, providing the reality against which LLM predictions are compared. It involves establishing labeled datasets that represent the true outcomes, allowing for objective evaluation of the model’s accuracy and effectiveness in capturing real-world language patterns.\n\nThrough ground truth evaluation, the strengths and limitations of LLMs can be identified, enabling improvements in their performance and application across diverse domains.\n\n### Model Comparison\n\nWhen businesses and researchers are faced with selecting an LLM, they look for comprehensive data to compare performance. By implementing LLM performance evaluation techniques, they obtain comparative insights into fluency, coherence, and the ability of models to handle domain-specific content.\n\n### Bias Detection and Mitigation\n\nBias detection is an essential element of the current model evaluation techniques, identifying situations where the model might produce prejudiced outcomes. Effective LLM or [AI agent evaluation](https://aisera.com/blog/ai-agent-evaluation/) aids in strategizing improvements, ensuring outputs from LLMs are fair and ethical.\n\n### Comparative Analysis\n\nIn LLM performance evaluation, alongside tracking model evolution, hands-on user feedback, and satisfaction metrics, the integration and impact of [LLM embeddings](https://aisera.com/blog/llm-embeddings/) also need to be considered. By examining the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, a comparative analysis helps chart a course for enhanced user trust and better-aligned AI solutions.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Performance Indicator | Metric | Application in LLM Evaluation |\n| Accuracy | Task Success Rate | Measuring the model’s ability to produce correct responses to prompts |\n| Fluency | Perplexity | Assessing the natural flow and readability of text generated by the LLM |\n| Relevance | ROUGE Scores | Evaluating content relevance and alignment with user input |\n| Bias | Disparity Analysis | Identifying and mitigating biases within model responses |\n| Coherence | Coh-Metrix | Analyzing logical consistency and clarity over longer stretches of text |\n\nThe pursuit of excellence in artificial intelligence through comprehensive LLM performance evaluation methods not only propels the field forward but also ensures that the AI systems we build reflect our values and serve our needs efficiently.\n\n## Model Evaluations vs System Evaluations\n\nUnderstanding the nuances between LLM evaluations and LLM system evaluations is critical for stakeholders looking to harness the full potential of large language models. LLM model evaluations are designed to gauge the raw capability of the models, focusing on their ability to understand, generate, and manipulate language within the appropriate context.\n\nIn contrast, system evaluations are tailored to observe how these models perform within a predetermined framework, examining functionalities that are within the user’s influence.\n\nEvaluating LLMs encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks and diverse predefined evaluation metrics to ensure objectivity and precision. For those pondering how to evaluate models and LLMs effectively, appreciating the differences and applications of these two types of evaluations is fundamental. Here we break down and compare the essential metrics used in model vs. system evaluations:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Evaluation Criteria | Model Evaluation | System Evaluation |\n| Primary Focus | Overall performance and intelligence of the LLM on multiple tasks | Specific use-case effectiveness and integration within a system |\n| Metrics Used | Multitasking measures such as MMLU, complexity, and coherence | Precision, recall, and system-specific success rates |\n| End Goal | Broad evaluation across a range of scenarios | Optimization of prompts and user experience |\n| Impact on Development | Informs foundational development and enhancements | Directly affects user interaction and satisfaction |\n\nFor developers and machine learning practitioners, the distinction between these evaluations is much more than academic; it directly influences their work and strategic approach toward improving LLM evaluation methods.\n\nFoundational model builders consistently push the frontiers of what their LLM can do, testing it against divergent cases and refining its core functionalities. Meanwhile, system evaluators prioritize how to evaluate LLM effectiveness within specific contexts, often necessitating frequent iterations to enhance the user experience and overall system reliability.\n\n* Model evaluators question, “How comprehensive and adaptable is the LLM?”\n* System evaluators ask, “How well does this LLM perform for the specific tasks at hand?”\n\nTaking these differences into account enables targeted strategies for advancing LLMs. Therefore, evaluating large language models through both lenses ensures a comprehensive understanding of their capacities and limitations, thereby supporting the development of more efficient, ethical, and usable AI systems.\n\n## 5 Benchmarking Steps for a Better Evaluation\n\nTo determine benchmark performance and measure LLM evaluation edge cases comprehensively, a structured approach is vital. These five steps can streamline the process and enhance the accuracy of your evaluations.\n\n1. **Curate benchmark tasks:** Design a set of language tasks that cover a spectrum from simple to complex, ensuring the benchmark captures the breadth of LLM capabilities.\n2. **Prepare datasets:** Use diverse, representative datasets that have been carefully curated to avoid biases and evaluate the LLM’s performance on a level playing field.\n3. **Implement fine-tuning:** LLM fine-tuning techniques and [LLM gateway](https://aisera.com/blog/llm-gateway-for-generative-ai/) using the prepared datasets to bolster the LLM’s ability to handle language tasks effectively.\n4. **Evaluate with metrics:** Utilize established evaluation metrics such as perplexity, ROUGE, and diversity to assess the performance of the LLM objectively.\n5. **Analyze results:** Interpret the data gathered to compare and contrast the performance of different LLMs, offering insights that could guide future improvements.\n\nUpon completing these steps, you’ll have a thorough understanding of how LLMs perform under a variety of scenarios, which is essential for LLM applications and further development. Below is a detailed table summarizing the key performance metrics used in LLM evaluation.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Metric | Description | Application |\n| Perplexity | Measures uncertainty in predicting the next token. | General language proficiency |\n| ROUGE | Compares an LLM’s output with a set of reference summaries. | Summarization tasks |\n| Diversity | Evaluates the variety of responses generated. | Creativity and variation in output |\n| Human Evaluation | Subjective assessment by human judges. | Relevance and coherence |\n\n## LLM Evaluation Best Practices\n\nIn the realm of large language model evaluation, precision in methodology is paramount. Enhancing the integrity and effectiveness of evaluations requires adherence to established best practices. Armed with [LLM strategy](https://aisera.com/blog/llm-strategy-build-buy/), developers and researchers can proficiently navigate the complexities of LLM evaluation and progression.\n\n### Leveraging LLMOps\n\nCentral to refining LLM evaluation processes is the strategic utilization of\xa0[LLMOps](https://aisera.com/blog/llmops/). This practice involves the orchestration and automation of LLM workflows to avoid data contamination and biases.\n\nLLMOps role in evaluation is to create a repeatable and scalable process. By adding automated tests to continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, teams can ensure every new model update or fine tuning run is tested against a consistent “golden dataset”. This saves time and provides an objective, data driven record of model performance over time which is critical for making decisions. This also creates an immutable audit trail of model changes so transparency and compliance.\n\nCollaborative tools and operational frameworks, often offered by esteemed institutions, are pivotal in achieving consistent and transparent results. These systems allow practitioners to rigorously assess and deploy language models while facilitating accountability for the data sources they incorporate.\n\n### Multiple LLM evaluation metrics\n\nIn the pursuit of LLM evaluation best practices, deploying a diversity of metrics is non-negotiable. It is critical that evaluations are not monolithic but rather encompass a broad spectrum, assessing fluency, coherence, relevance, and context understanding.\n\nEvaluating large language models with multifaceted metrics not only reflects the nuanced capabilities of these systems but also ensures their applicability across various communication domains. Such rigorous scrutiny bolsters the reliability and versatility of the models in question.\n\n### Real-world evaluation\n\nBeyond lab-controlled conditions lies the realm of real-world applications — a space where theory meets pragmatism. Validating LLMs through practical usage scenarios confirms their effectiveness, user satisfaction, and adaptability to unexpected variables.\n\nThis practice takes large language model evaluation out of the abstract and deposits it firmly in the tangible, user-centric world where the true test of utility takes place. Furthermore, integrating known training data into evaluations ensures that the datasets mirror a wide range of acceptable responses, making the evaluation as encompassing and comprehensive as possible.\n\n## LLM Evaluation Beyond the Lab: The Real-World Challenge\n\nWhile metrics and benchmark datasets are important, they often don’t capture the subtleties of real-world use. LLMs are not static; they operate in a dynamic environment where user intent, contextual cues and data variability change constantly. A model that does great on an academic benchmark might fail in production because of slight changes in user prompts or unexpected edge cases.\n\nThat’s where “continuous evaluation” comes in. It’s a shift from a one-time assessment to an ongoing, iterative process. Instead of just relying on offline metrics, you need to set up a feedback loop that incorporates real-time user interactions. That means monitoring for declines in user satisfaction, increases in toxic outputs and new, unhandled query types.\n\nAnd real-world evaluation means going beyond just the output. It means evaluating the whole system, including the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. Are the documents retrieved actually relevant? Are they being properly cited? The full-stack approach to evaluation, that includes the LLM and its surrounding architecture, is what separates a good model from a production-ready, enterprise-grade solution.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the comprehensive standardized evaluation framework of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a cornerstone in the advancement of AI technologies. It ensures that these powerful tools are not only effective but also align with ethical standards and practical needs.\n\nAs LLMs continue to evolve, [Enterprise LLM](https://aisera.com/products/llm/)\xa0emerges as a pivotal aspect, offering tailored, accessible AI solutions across industries. This approach underscores the importance of meticulous LLM evaluation methods in delivering reliable, bias-free, and efficient AI services.\n\nMonitoring the performance and accuracy of LLMs is essential. But to achieve high-performing large language models that meet all evaluation metrics, it is recommended to use retrieval augmented generation ([RAG](https://aisera.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/)) or fine-tuning methods on [domain-specific LLMs.](https://aisera.com/blog/domain-specific-llm/)\n\nYou can see the [AI agents benchmark](https://aisera.com/ai-agents-evaluation/) report as an excellent step if you are eager to witness the transformative impact of [domain-specific AI Agents](https://aisera.com/blog/domain-specific-ai-agents/) firsthand. It provides an opportunity to experience the capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications and understand their potential to drive innovation and efficiency.\n\n## LLM Evaluation FAQs\n\n### What are LLM evaluations?\n\nLLM evaluations are methods to assess a model’s performance on tasks like reasoning, language understanding, safety, and factual accuracy.\n\n### What is the evaluation metrics of an LLM?\n\nLLM evaluation metrics include answer correctness, semantic similarity, and hallucination.

INTRODUCTION**\n\nWith the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their\napplications in fields such as text generation, automated\nevaluation, and educational feedback have become increasingly\nwidespread [[6](#Xchen2023language)]). Particularly in higher education, LLMs are\ngradually being utilized to assist in grading, provide feedback,\nand enhance the student learning experience [[13](#X2010Improving)]. However,\nhow to effectively evaluate the performance of LLMs in\nthese tasks remains an open question. Current evaluation\nmethods mostly rely on benchmark tests, such as GLUE\nand SuperGLUE [[20](#Xlyu2024evaluating)], or accuracy assessments based on\nhuman annotations. Yet, these methods may have certain\nlimitations in educational contexts, such as failing to capture\nthe reasonableness, relevance, and practicality of LLM\nfeedback.\n\nIn the field of computer science education, graduate-level\ncourses often involve complex design-oriented projects, such as\nObject-Oriented Design and Development (OODD). The\nlearning objectives of such courses not only include mastering\ntechnical knowledge but also emphasize critical thinking,\nteamwork, and iterative development based on feedback\n[[22](#X2025Creating)].\n\nIn these courses, one workable and efficient way is to let\nstudents peer-review each other’s project reports [[10](#Xgehringer2007reusable)]. This\npeer review mechanism can provide valuable feedback and\nhelp students understand evaluation criteria and improve\nproject design [[7](#X2023Visualizing)]. If LLMs can accurately simulate or\nenhance this review process, their potential for application in\neducational scenarios will significantly increase. Therefore,\nthis study proposes a method that utilizes peer review\ndata from an OODD graduate course as a benchmark\nto evaluate the review outcomes generated by different\nLLMs, aiming to explore the most suitable model for this\ntask.\n\nExisting research has explored the capabilities of LLMs in\nautomated grading and feedback generation. For example, D.\nBhatnagar [[3](#Xbhatnagar2023fine)] investigated the performance of GPT-3 in providing\nfeedback on programming assignments and found that it was\neffective in detecting errors and offering general suggestions\nbut lacked a deep understanding of task-specific contexts.\nAdditionally, Reference[[5](#Xchang2024survey)] observed that feedback generated\nby LLMs often lacks consistency, potentially providing\ncontradictory suggestions under different circumstances.\nTherefore, relying solely on traditional evaluation methods may\nnot sufficiently measure the performance of LLMs in educational\nscenarios.\n\nTraditional evaluation methods for LLMs typically rely on\nstandard datasets and automated metrics, such as BLEU,\nROUGE, and BERTScore [[20](#Xlyu2024evaluating)]. While these methods offer\ncertain advantages in assessing text generation quality, their\neffectiveness is limited when applied to complex tasks involving\nhuman interaction, such as educational feedback generation [[25](#X2024An)].\nFor instance, evaluation methods based on automated metrics\nfail to comprehensively capture the reasonableness and practical\nimpact of feedback [[4](#Xbui_chatgpt_2025)]. In educational settings, feedback\nnot only needs to accurately identify issues but should\nalso be constructive and provide specific suggestions for\nimprovement[[9](#Xfong2018feedback)].\n\nThe primary goal of this study is to propose and validate an\nLLM evaluation framework based on peer review data,\nspecifically focusing on the following aspects:\n\n(1) Constructing a benchmark dataset. The original data was\ncollected from a graduate-level OODD course on Expertiza [[10](#Xgehringer2007reusable)]\nfor multiple semesters and tagged by the students who\nparticipated in this class. Table [1](#some-examples-of-the-peer-review-data) shows some examples of\ntagged data.\n\nTable 1: Some examples of the peer review data\n\n| Question from the review rubric | Feedback | Tag prompt | Tag value |\n| Are there any missing attributes for the admin? | No | Contains explanation? | -1 |\n| Are there any missing attributes for a user? | credit card number was not asked for at any point | Contains explanation? | 1 |\n| Are there any missing attributes for the admin? | No | Positive Tone? | -1 |\n| Are there any missing attributes for the admin? | Good job, I see them all. | Positive Tone? | 1 |\n\n(2) Finetuning LLM(s) to setup the metrics from the tagged\ndata.\n\n(3) Evaluate the performance of the metrics from the finetuned\nLLM(s).\n\nThis framework aims to systematically assess the capabilities of\nLLMs in generating educational feedback and identify the most\neffective model for enhancing peer review processes in higher\neducation.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2\nreviews existing LLM evaluation methods and discusses relevant\nresearch on LLMs in educational feedback tasks. Section 3\nintroduces the methodology of this study, including dataset\nconstruction, definition of evaluation metrics, and experimental\nsetup. Section 4 details the experimental design and presents a\ncomparative analysis of feedback generated by different LLMs.\nSection 5 discusses the experimental results, analyzing the\neffectiveness and applicability of LLM-generated feedback.\nSection 6 addresses the limitations of the study and outlines\npotential directions for future research. Section 7 summarizes\nthe findings and provides recommendations for optimizing LLMs\nin educational assessment.\n\n# **2. RELATED WORK**\n\n## **2.1 Overview of Evaluation Methods for Large Language Models**\n\nThe evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily\ninvolves automated metrics, benchmark dataset assessments,\nand human evaluations. Traditional automated evaluation\nmetrics, such as BLEU [[23](#X2002BLEU)], ROUGE[[16](#Xlin2004rouge)], and METEOR [[2](#Xbanerjee2005meteor)], are\nwidely used in natural language processing tasks. However,\nthese metrics typically rely on surface-level similarity to\nreference texts and fail to adequately measure the logicality,\ncoherence, and reasonableness of generated text [[5](#Xchang2024survey)]. In recent\nyears, deep learning-based evaluation methods such as\nBERTScore [[29](#Xzhang2019bertscore)] and MoverScore [[30](#Xzhao2019moverscore)] have partially addressed\nthis problem. However, they still face limitations when directly\napplied to educational scenarios [[12](#Xgehrmann2022photon)].\n\nHuman evaluation remains an indispensable part of LLM\nassessment. For example, OpenAI adopted a method based on\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF))[[17](#Xliu2020personalized)] in\nthe development of GPT series models to improve the quality\nand acceptability of generated text. However, human evaluation\noften suffers from subjectivity, high costs, and difficulty in\nscaling up, which prompts researchers to explore more objective\nand reproducible LLM evaluation methods.\n\n## **2.2 Rationality analysis of peer evaluation in design projects**\n\nIn the field of computer science education, peer review has been\nwidely used for course evaluation and student feedback\ngeneration. The advantage of peer evaluation is that it can\npromote students’ critical thinking, increase the diversity of\nfeedback, and reduce the workload of teachers. In addition,\nresearch has shown that effective peer evaluation can help\nstudents better understand evaluation criteria and enhance their\nself-directed learning abilities[[18](#Xliu2006peer)].\n\nIn graduate courses, especially those involving complex project\ndesign (such as object-oriented design and development), peer\nevaluation is commonly used to assess the quality of project\nreports and provide improvement suggestions [[27](#Xzeid2005peer)]. However,\nresearch has found that students may have scoring biases,\nlack effective feedback, and inconsistent understanding of\nstandards when conducting peer evaluations. Therefore,\nhow to improve the rationality and effectiveness of peer\nevaluation has become an important issue in educational\nresearch.\n\nRecent research has explored automatic feedback generation\nbased on LLM to assist or replace manual peer evaluation.\nFor example, Kulkarni et al. developed an automated\nevaluation system that combines machine learning and\nnatural language processing techniques to provide targeted\nfeedback to students[[15](#Xkulkarni2024automated)] . Other studies focus on how to use\nLLM to generate feedback that meets educational quality\nstandards, such as providing specific recommendations,\navoiding ambiguous evaluations, and using constructive\nlanguage[[21](#Xnicol2010foundation)].\n\n## **2.3 The Application of LLM in Educational Evaluation**\n\nThe application of LLM in the field of education is becoming\nincreasingly widespread, covering multiple aspects such as\nautomatic grading, intelligent tutoring, and paper generation\ndetection [[28](#Xzhai2022chatgpt)]. For example, GPT-4 developed by OpenAI has\nbeen used to generate academic writing feedback and compared\nwith traditional scoring systems [[14](#Xkasneci2023chatgpt)]. In addition, the Google\nresearch team proposed an intelligent education system based\non PaLM 2, which can generate detailed feedback on student\nresponses and predict possible misunderstandings[[1](#Xanil2023palm)].\n\nIn peer evaluation environments, LLM is mainly used to\nautomatically generate feedback and assist teachers and\nstudents in improving the quality of evaluations [[11](#Xgehrmann2023repairing)]. Research\nhas shown that using feedback generated by LLM can\nsignificantly improve the objectivity of evaluations and reduce\ngrading bias among students [[19](#Xlu2024generative)]. However, there are still\nconsistency issues with the feedback generated by existing\nLLMs, such as generating comments with different styles or\ncontent for the same input [[26](#Xwu2024survey)].\n\nTo address these issues, this study proposes an LLM evaluation\nframework based on peer evaluation data of graduate design\nprojects, which measures the rationality, operability, and\nconsistency of LLM generated feedback by annotating key tags.\nThis method not only helps to screen the most suitable LLM for\nthe task, but also provides data support for future LLM\nevaluation research.\n\n## **2.4 Model fine-tuning method DPO**\n\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO)[[24](#Xrafailov2024direct)] is a model\nfine-tuning method that focuses on directly learning from user\npreferences rather than relying on indirect reward signals.\nHuman preferences are assumed to follow the **Bradley-Terry\nmodel**, where the probability of preferring one response over\nanother depends on the difference in their rewards:\n\nwhere \nis an unknown reward function, and  is preferred over\n.\n\nBy introducing a **KL divergence constraint**, the reward function\nis implicitly defined as the log-probability difference between the\nlearned policy () and a reference policy ():\n\nwhere  is a\nhyperparameter controlling how much the learned policy can\ndeviate from the reference model.\n\nThe problem of maximizing preference likelihood is reformulated\nas minimizing the following loss:\n\nwhere  and  denote the\npreferred and dispreferred responses respectively, and  is the\nsigmoid function.  \nBy collecting user feedback through comparative choices, DPO\nadjusts the model’s behavior to better align with user\nexpectations. This approach is particularly effective in\napplications like recommendation systems and natural language\nprocessing, where understanding user satisfaction is crucial.\nDPO enhances user experience by optimizing model outputs\nbased on explicit preference data, ultimately improving\nengagement and trust.\n\n# **3. METHOD**\n\nThis study aims to finetune LLMs to evaluate the performance\nof different LLMs in automatically generating educational\nfeedback through a peer evaluation dataset of graduate design\nprojects. The research methods mainly include dataset\nconstruction, definition of evaluation tags, , and evaluation\nmethods. This section briefly introduces the data processing\nflow, LLM evaluation methods, and quantitative tags used to\nanalyze model performance.\n\n## **3.1 Research Flow Diagram**\n\nIn the object-oriented programming course, a large-scale model\nis fine-tuned using 11 tags to finetune LLMs, to evaluate the\nquality of LLM-generated contents. The process is shown in\nFigure [1](#research-flow-diagram1).\n\nFrom the perspective of the evaluation method, in the\nindependent evaluation, the retriever evaluation can measure\nthe model’s accuracy in retrieving information related to course\nprojects based on these tags. For example, the “Relevant"\nindicator reflects the relevance between the retrieval and the\nproject. The generation/synthesis evaluation focuses on\nthe rationality and relevance of the evaluation content\ngenerated by the model based on these tags. In the end-to-end\nevaluation, when there are labels, the performance of tags like\n“Suggests Actions" can be compared to the accuracy in the\nevaluation; when there are no labels, tags such as "Uses Positive\nTone" reflect the fidelity and relevance of the evaluation.\nRegarding the key tags, “Answer Relevance" corresponds to\n“Relevant", and “Answer Fidelity" can be judged by tags like\n"Includes Explanation" and “Consistent with Scoring". In\nterms of key capabilities, the performance of the model\nin tags such as “Helpful" and “Localized" can reflect its\ninformation integration ability and noise robustness. Finally, a\ncomprehensive comparison is conducted across models based on\nthe evaluation tags to assess the overall quality of their\nperformance.\n\n## **3.2 Dataset Construction**\n\n### 3.2.1 Dataset Construction\n\nThe dataset for this study is sourced from a graduate-level\ncourse for multiple semesters from Expertiza [[10](#Xgehringer2007reusable)]. This data\nincludes project reports submitted by students from multiple\nsemesters and corresponding peer review comments. These\nreview comments are written by students in the course,\naiming to provide evaluation and improvement suggestions\nfor the project and feedback on various aspects such as\ntechnology, structure, and code quality. The raw data is stored\nin an SQL database, and the anonymized retrieved data\nincluding:\n\n1. Project report submitted by students (original\n   PDF/text format).\n2. Question from the rubric to help the students do\n   peer-reviewing.\n3. Peer review comments (structured text, including\n   ratings and written feedback).\n4. Tags, including the name and the value, to show if the\n   comments fit the tag.\n5. Credibility score of the tags.\n\n### 3.2.2 Data preprocessing\n\nIn the object-oriented programming course, we fine-tune a\nlarge-language model using 11 tags (namely, Contains Praise,\nIdentifies Problems, Offers Solutions, Uses Positive Tone,\nMitigates Criticism, Localized, Helpful, Includes Explanation,\nSuggests Actions, Relevant, and Consistent with Scoring) to\ngenerate a teaching assistant model. The specific meanings of\nthe 11 tags are shown in Table [2](#evaluation-criteria)\n\nTable 2: Evaluation Criteria\n\n| Tag Number | Evaluation Dimension | Description |\n| M1 | Contains Praise | Acknowledges strengths of the project. |\n| M2 | Identifies Problems | Points out shortcomings. |\n| M3 | Offers Solutions | Provides suggestions for improvement. |\n| M4 | Uses Positive Tone | Avoids negative language. |\n| M5 | Mitigates Criticism | Lessens impact via tactful expression. |\n| M6 | Localized | Specific to the project. |\n| M7 | Helpful | Substantial assistance for the reviewer. |\n| M8 | Includes Explanation | Explains reasons behind evaluation. |\n| M9 | Suggests Actions | Advises specific actions. |\n| M10 | Relevant | Relates to project content. |\n| M11 | Consistent with Scoring | Aligns with provided score. |\n\nTo ensure the quality and consistency of the data, the following\npreprocessing steps were carried out in this study. First, A\nthreshold  of the credibility score [[8](#Xda2016prediction)] of the tags has been\napplied to keep the quality of the tagged data. Then, due to the\nlimitations of fine-tuning different LLMs, a trade-off between\ncost and time was made by setting 50 positive and 50 negative\nsamples for each tag.\n\n## **3.3 Dataset segmentation**\n\nThe dataset was preprocessed and annotated with 11 key tags\n(see Section 3.2 for details). To ensure the fairness of the\nevaluation, we divide the data in the following way:  \n(1) Train Set (60%)  \nUsed for fine-tuning some LLMs (such as Mistral-7B that\nsupports LoRA training). Provide high-quality peer review\nsamples for LLM to conduct supervised learning.  \n(2) Validation Set (20%)  \nAs a tuning dataset for LLM feedback generation, it is used to\nadjust hyperparameters such as temperature, Top-k, Top-p.\nEnsure that the feedback generated by the model is semantically\nconsistent with human feedback.  \n(3) Test Set (20%)  \nMainly used for the final evaluation of feedback generated\nby LLM. Do not participate in fine-tuning to ensure the\nindependence of the test set. All data is randomly divided in\nchronological order (across semesters) and ensures that data\nfrom different semesters are evenly distributed in the training,\nvalidation, and testing sets.\n\n## **3.4 LLMs Finetuning**\n\nFine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for generating\nevaluation metrics involves adapting pre-trained models to\nassess specific dimensions of feedback quality effectively. This\nprocess typically leverages domain-specific datasets, such as\nannotated peer review comments, to refine the model’s\nability to classify and quantify key evaluation criteria.\nTechniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and supervised\nfine-tuning allow LLMs to learn from structured human\nevaluations, ensuring alignment with predefined metrics,\nsuch as problem identification, solution suggestions, and\ntone analysis. Additionally, RLHF can further optimize\nthe model’s scoring consistency by iteratively refining its\nability to distinguish between constructive and ineffective\nfeedback. Fine-tuned LLMs can thus generate reliable,\nstandardized evaluation metrics that support automated\nassessment processes, minimizing human bias while improving\nscalability and objectivity in educational and research\napplications.\n\n# **4. IMPLEMENTATION**\n\nThis study selects some mainstream LLMs for experimentation,\nincluding GPT-4o, Deepseek and Llama3. These models\ndemonstrate exceptional performance in text generation and\nunderstanding tasks, making them suitable candidates for\nautomatic review tasks and effectively meeting the requirements\nof various application scenarios.\n\n## **4.1 Metrics with LLMs Based on the Tagging Data**\n\nTo ensure the fairness of the experiments, we established a\nuniform prompt structure for the evaluating LLMs:\n\n`Prompt for Finetune LLMs`\n\n```\nprompt\xa0=\xa0(\nf"Review_Comment:\xa0\\"{review_comment}\\"\\n"\n"Classify\xa0the\xa0following\xa0tags\xa0as\xa0json\xa0{tags}:\\n"\n"You\xa0should\xa0generate\xa0the\xa0tag\xa0value\nas\xa0\\"{value}\\",\xa0which\xa0-1\xa0means\xa0negative\nand\xa01\xa0means\xa0positive.\\n"\n"Answer\xa0in\xa0JSON\xa0format\xa0as\xa0the\xa0{\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\\"most_rel_tag\\":\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0{tag},\xa0\\"tag_value":{value}}."\n)\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\n```\n\nAfter completing the fine-tuning process with DPO, the\nLLMs designated for evaluation are fully prepared and\noptimized to function as objective assessment metrics for\nanalyzing outputs generated by various applications, including\nchatbots and other language models. These fine-tuned\nmodels have been trained to apply predefined evaluation\ntagging metrics. By leveraging domain-specific datasets\nand reinforcement learning techniques, the models are\ncapable of providing structured, quantifiable evaluations\nthat minimize human bias while maintaining reliability.\nTheir deployment enables automated, scalable evaluation\nof text-based AI outputs, facilitating improvements in\ngenerative model performance and refining their responses\nbased on well-defined quality standards. This approach\nenhances transparency and standardization in assessing\nAI-generated content across different applications and\ndomains.\n\n## **4.2 Metrics with LLMs Based on Giving Definition**\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of the evaluation metrics produced by\nfine-tuned LLMs, we implement a traditional verification\napproach by manually examining whether the generated content\naligns with the predefined evaluation criteria. This process\ninvolves explicitly defining the desired metrics within the\nevaluator LLM, ensuring that it applies them consistently when\nanalyzing generated text. By systematically comparing the\nmodel’s assessments with human-labeled data or established\nbenchmarks, we can determine the accuracy and reliability of its\nevaluations. This method allows for direct validation of\nthe fine-tuned model’s ability to detect key attributes,\nsuch as coherence, problem identification, and constructive\nfeedback mentioned in the previous sections. Additionally, it\nprovides insights into potential discrepancies or areas for\nfurther optimization, enabling iterative refinements to\nimprove the model’s performance in automated evaluation\ntasks.\n\n## **4.3 Validate the Effectiveness of the Metrics**\n\nFrom Section [3.3](#x1-29r3), the test data has been segmented. To\nsystematically compare the three evaluation methods—direct\nuse of an LLM, fine-tuned LLM evaluation, and the metric\ndefinition approach—we follow a structured process.\nFirst, we apply the direct LLM evaluation by prompting\na general-purpose LLM (without fine-tuning) to assess\ngenerated text based on predefined evaluation criteria. The\nmodel’s raw responses are then collected and analyzed for\nconsistency and accuracy. Next, we employ the fine-tuned LLM\napproach, where an LLM specifically trained on labeled\npeer review data evaluates the same text. This allows us\nto measure improvements in metric alignment, scoring\nconsistency, and adaptability to domain-specific nuances.\nFinally, we use the metric definition method, in which\nwe explicitly encode evaluation criteria into the LLM’s\nsystem instructions or prompt structure, ensuring it applies\nstructured metrics consistently. To compare these methods, we\nanalyze key performance indicators such as agreement with\nhuman-labeled references, inter-method consistency, and\nrobustness across different text inputs. Quantitative measures,\nincluding correlation scores and classification accuracy,\nalong with qualitative insights from human evaluation, help\ndetermine which approach offers the most reliable and\nscalable assessment framework for evaluating AI-generated\ncontent.\n\n# **5. RESULTS**\n\n## **5.1 Comparison Among Metrics with Test Set**\n\nWe have set up and fine-tuned multiple LLMs to conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation. GPT-4o is based on the online API\nusing gpt-4o-2024-08-06 from OpenAI, providing access\nto its advanced capabilities in real-time, while DeepSeek\n(DeepSeek-r1-7b) and Llama 3 (Llama3-7b) are running locally,\nallowing for controlled experimentation and customization.\nTable [3](#the-comparison-of-accuracy-for-methods-on-mainstream-llms) shows the accuracy of the test data.\n\nTable 3: The comparison of accuracy for 3 methods on 3\nmainstream LLMs.\n\n| LLM | Methods | | |\n|  | Metric definitions | Direct (no definition) | Fine-tuned |\n| GPT-4o | 75.34% | 75.24% | 79.82% |\n| Deepseek | 71.23% | 69.20% | 76.86% |\n| Llama3 | 71.14% | 68.75% | 76.20% |\n\nFrom the result in Table [3](#the-comparison-of-accuracy-for-methods-on-mainstream-llms), when evaluating the accuracy\nof different LLM-based metrics, it becomes evident that\nfine-tuned models outperform both the direct-use approach and\nthe metric definition method in assessing the quality of\ngenerated text. Fine-tuned LLMs are specifically trained\non annotated datasets, allowing them to develop a more\nnuanced understanding of evaluation criteria and consistently\napply them across different text inputs. In contrast, the\ndirect-use approach, where an unmodified LLM is prompted to\nassess quality, often produces inconsistent or overly generic\nevaluations, as it lacks targeted training for the specific task.\nMeanwhile, the metric definition method, which involves\nexplicitly encoding evaluation criteria into prompts or system\ninstructions, offers improved structure and alignment but still\nfalls short in capturing contextual nuances and adapting to\ndiverse text variations. By systematically comparing these\nmethods, we observe that fine-tuned LLMs provide the most\naccurate assessments relevant to the given context, making\nthem the superior choice for automated text evaluation\ntasks.\n\n## **5.2 Evaluating the LLM-based Metrics with the Generated Contents**\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the metrics derived from\nfine-tuned LLMs, we designed a structured task to assess the\nquality of feedback generated for given assignments. In this\nprocess, the fine-tuned models analyze student submissions and\nassign evaluation tags based on predefined criteria, such as\nclarity, constructiveness, and relevance. To ensure accuracy and\nreliability, a human instructor manually reviews the assigned\ntags, verifying whether they correctly reflect the feedback\ncontent. Any discrepancies between the model-generated tags\nand the instructor’s judgment are recorded and analyzed\nto identify potential weaknesses in the LLM’s evaluation\nprocess.\n\nTable [4](#examples-of-tagging-on-students-feedback-for-the-submission-with-real-data) shows some examples of the evaluation from both\nfinetune LLMs and human instructors in this class. LLM\ngenerates the contents, feeding the data described in Section\n[3.3](#x1-29r3), and evaluated by human instructors and the finetuned\nLLMs.\n\n\n\nA total of 110 structured feedback examples—similar in format\nto those presented in Table [4](#examples-of-tagging-on-students-feedback-for-the-submission-with-real-data) were assessed to compare the\naccuracy of human evaluations and fine-tuned LLM-based\nmetrics. These feedback samples were systematically categorized\nbased on 11 evaluation tags, with each tag containing five\npositive and five negative examples, ensuring a balanced dataset\nfor analysis. The evaluation process involved two parallel\nassessments: one conducted by human instructors, who\nmanually reviewed each feedback instance and assigned\nappropriate tags, and another by the fine-tuned LLM,\nwhich automatically classified the feedback according to the\npredefined criteria. The results from both methods were then\ncompared to measure alignment, consistency, and potential\ndiscrepancies.\n\nTable 5: Evaluation comparing between finetuned LLMs and\nhuman instructors. There are 10 cases for each tag (M1 to\nM11).\n\n| Tags | Finetuned LLM-based metrics | | | Human Instructors | |\n|  | GPT-4o | DeepSeek | Llama3 | Instructor 1 | Instructor 2 |\n| M1 | 9 | 8 | 6 | 10 | 10 |\n| M2 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 10 | 10 |\n| M3 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 9 | 9 |\n| M4 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 10 | 10 |\n| M5 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 10 | 9 |\n| M6 | 7 | 6 | 6 | 10 | 9 |\n| M7 | 9 | 6 | 6 | 10 | 9 |\n| M8 | 7 | 6 | 6 | 10 | 10 |\n| M9 | 10 | 7 | 7 | 10 | 10 |\n| M10 | 10 | 7 | 8 | 10 | 10 |\n| M11 | 7 | 8 | 6 | 9 | 9 |\n\nTable [5](#evaluation-comparing-between-finetuned-llms-and-human-instructors-there-are-cases-for-each-tag-m-to-m) shows that fine-tuned LLM-based metrics can achieve\nperformance levels comparable to human instructors in\nevaluating feedback quality. By systematically analyzing the\nalignment between model-generated assessments and instructor\njudgments, we observe a high degree of agreement across key\nevaluation criteria, such as problem identification, solution\nsuggestion, and constructive tone. The fine-tuned models,\ntrained on annotated peer review data, consistently apply\npredefined metrics, reducing subjectivity and variability often\npresent in human evaluations. Additionally, statistical analysis\nshows that the model’s tagging accuracy closely matches\nhuman-labeled benchmarks, with minimal discrepancies in\ncases requiring nuanced interpretation. These findings\nsuggest that with proper fine-tuning and domain-specific\nadaptation, LLM-based evaluation metrics can serve as\nreliable, scalable alternatives to human assessment, offering\nefficiency and objectivity while maintaining human-level\nperformance.\n\n# **6. CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThis study proposes an objective evaluation framework based on\npeer evaluation data from graduate design projects to measure\nthe performance of different large language models (LLMs) in\nautomatically generating educational feedback tasks. We\nselected mainstream LLMs and conducted a comprehensive\nanalysis of their generated feedback. We evaluated them based\non 11 key tags, such as whether constructive suggestions were\nprovided, whether a positive tone was used, and whether they\nwere consistent with ratings. The experimental results show\nthat the finetuned LLM-based metrics perform the best overall,\noutperforming other models in multiple dimensions such\nas feedback accuracy, relevance, localization, and rating\nconsistency.\n\nHowever, despite advancements in using LLMs for automated\nevaluation, several limitations persist in this field. First,\nfine-tuned models may inherit biases from training data, leading\nto skewed assessments that reflect the subjective tendencies of\nhuman annotators rather than objective evaluation standards.\nAdditionally, LLMs often struggle with interpretability, making\nit difficult to understand how they arrive at specific assessment\nscores, which reduces trust in their decision-making process.\nScalability is another challenge, as fine-tuning requires large\nannotated datasets and significant computational resources,\nlimiting accessibility for smaller research groups or institutions.\nFurthermore, LLM-based metrics may lack adaptability across\ndomains, as a model fine-tuned for one type of evaluation (e.g.,\nacademic writing feedback) may not generalize well to another\n(e.g., creative writing assessment). Finally, there remains\na gap between LLM-generated evaluations and human\njudgment, particularly in cases requiring deep contextual\nunderstanding, critical reasoning, or domain-specific expertise.\nAddressing these limitations will require improved fine-tuning\nmethodologies, more transparent evaluation frameworks, and\nhybrid approaches that integrate LLM assessments with human\noversight.\n\n# **7.

You’re not alone. Unlike traditional ML models with clear right or wrong answers, LLMs generate diverse outputs that require multidimensional evaluation.\n\nPicking the right LLM performance metrics isn\'t just academic—it directly affects your model\'s quality and business results. The wrong metrics lead to misguided optimization, while good evaluation frameworks drive continuous improvement.\n\nThis guide explores seven key metrics to measure LLM performance in generative AI systems.\n\n> We recently explored this topic on our Chain of Thought podcast, where industry experts shared practical insights and real-world implementation strategies.\n\n![Image 3](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/mrYn6_6gJuY/maxresdefault.webp)\n\nWhat are LLM Performance Metrics?\n---------------------------------\n\nLLM performance metrics are quantitative measurements used to evaluate how well a large language model performs across various dimensions. These metrics provide standardized ways to assess model capabilities, identify weaknesses, and track improvements over time.\n\nTraditional ML evaluation uses deterministic metrics like accuracy and precision, assuming clear, correct answers exist. LLM performance metrics are fundamentally different because these models can generate multiple equally valid outputs for the same input.\n\nThe generative nature of LLMs creates a many-to-many relationship between inputs and acceptable outputs. Ask "summarize this article," and dozens of different summaries might be equally valid—with different details but preserving core information.\n\nUnlike classification models that fit into a neat confusion matrix, LLMs need evaluation frameworks that simultaneously assess factual accuracy, relevance, coherence, safety, creativity, and efficiency. No single metric covers this complex landscape, making [mastering LLM evaluation](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/mastering-llm-evaluation-metrics-frameworks-and-techniques) a multidimensional challenge.\n\n[![Image 4: Learn how to create powerful, reliable AI agents with our in-depth eBook.](https://framerusercontent.com/images/edy13FwEWYq4oYrbNvMertNMCE.png?width=1200&height=600)](https://www.galileo.ai/ebook-mastering-agents)\n### Limitations of Traditional Metrics for Generative AI\n\nTraditional metrics designed for classification tasks break down with generative models because they assume a single correct answer exists. LLMs work in open-ended spaces where many diverse outputs can satisfy the same prompt.\n\nString-matching metrics like [BLEU](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/bleu-metric-ai-evaluation) and [ROUGE](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/rouge-ai) miss semantic equivalence, penalizing different but meaningful responses. A model might generate a factually correct answer using a completely different vocabulary than the reference text, getting an artificially low score despite high quality.\n\nThese problems become acute when evaluating creative text, reasoning, or domain-specific tasks where contextual knowledge matters. In these cases, models might generate outputs human experts judge as excellent but automated metrics rate poorly because they differ from references.\n\nThe following seven metrics offer a multidimensional approach to evaluating LLM performance across operational and performance dimensions.\n\nLLM Performance Metric #1: Latency\n----------------------------------\n\n[Latency](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/understanding-latency-in-ai-what-it-is-and-how-it-works) measures the time between submitting a prompt and receiving the complete response. This directly impacts user experience, especially for interactive applications where users expect responses in milliseconds, not seconds.\n\nGood latency measurement analyzes performance across multiple dimensions:\n\nPerformance varies dramatically—some models maintain consistent speed regardless of prompt complexity, while others slow dramatically with longer inputs.\n\nWhen optimizing latency, consider the entire request pipeline, not just model inference. Network transmission, pre-processing, tokenization, and post-processing all contribute to overall latency. Track each component to find bottlenecks.\n\nYou\'ll face trade-offs between latency and other metrics. Techniques that improve response quality (increased sampling temperature, larger batch sizes) may slow responses. Set latency budgets based on specific application needs, then optimize within those constraints.\n\nFor speed-critical applications, try [response streaming](https://gautam75.medium.com/streaming-llm-responses-importance-and-implementation-911b135ef541), [model quantization](https://medium.com/@sulbha.jindal/introduction-to-llm-quantization-d274020e6ab5), and [optimized inference](https://medium.com/@manindersingh120996/how-to-optimize-llm-inference-0076d9f3dd1b). Response caching for common queries and request batching for high-volume scenarios also help production deployments run faster.\n\nComparing your latency against competitive baseline models provides valuable context. Understanding relative performance helps teams make smart decisions about model selection and deployment configuration.\n\nGalileo\'s comprehensive [LLM monitoring](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-llm-monitoring-for-ai-professionals) tools track latency performance across different request types and loads, allowing teams to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize response times. Also, Galileo provides visualizations and alerting capabilities that help maintain latency within established SLAs.\n\nLLM Performance Metric #2: Throughput\n-------------------------------------\n\nThroughput quantifies your LLM system\'s processing capacity—typically measured in tokens per second, requests per minute, or queries per second. This impacts system scalability, costs, and ability to handle peak loads.\n\nUnlike latency (which focuses on individual request speed), throughput measures aggregate processing capability across multiple concurrent requests. A model might have excellent single-request latency but poor throughput with many simultaneous queries—a critical distinction for multi-user applications.\n\nOptimizing throughput typically involves hardware acceleration, batching strategies, and efficient resource allocation. GPU utilization, memory bandwidth, and parallel processing capabilities significantly impact performance. Monitor these factors alongside top-level throughput metrics to find optimization opportunities.\n\nFor large-scale deployments, throughput directly affects infrastructure costs and capacity planning. Understanding throughput needs for peak and average load scenarios helps right-size infrastructure and implement appropriate scaling policies. Over-provisioning wastes resources; under-provisioning risks service degradation during high demand.\n\nAdvanced optimization techniques include dynamic batch sizing (adjusting configuration based on current load) and heterogeneous computing (distributing processing across specialized hardware). [Quantization and model compression](https://medium.com/@bnjmn_marie/compression-techniques-for-llms-4eba6a6e622c) can also improve throughput by reducing computational needs.\n\nInclude stress testing in your benchmarks to understand throughput degradation under load. Many systems perform consistently up to a threshold, then rapidly deteriorate as resources saturate. Finding these inflection points helps establish safe operating [LLM parameters](https://www.galileo.ai/blog/llm-parameters-model-evaluation).\n\nGalileo\'s monitoring capabilities track processing capacity across varying traffic conditions, helping identify bottlenecks during peak usage periods. Teams can compare throughput metrics across model versions to ensure optimizations actually improve real-world performance.\n\nLLM Performance Metric #3: Perplexity\n-------------------------------------\n\nPerplexity quantifies how well a language model predicts text, measuring the model\'s "surprise" when encountering test data. Mathematically expressed as the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood per token, lower perplexity indicates better prediction.\n\nUnlike metrics that evaluate outputs against references, perplexity directly measures predictive language modeling capability. This makes it valuable for assessing model quality independent of specific generation tasks, revealing fundamental language understanding.\n\nDomain-specific perplexity evaluation across different text categories (technical documentation, conversations, creative writing) reveals model strengths and weaknesses. Establish perplexity benchmarks for relevant domains to contextualize measurements.\n\nWhile perplexity correlates with general language modeling quality, its relationship with task-specific performance is complex. Models with similar perplexity often show dramatically different capabilities on tasks like summarization or question answering, limiting its usefulness as a standalone metric.\n\nFor fine-tuned models, comparing perplexity between base and fine-tuned versions helps quantify domain adaptation. Significant perplexity improvements on domain-specific text indicate successful specialization, while dramatic degradation on general text might signal catastrophic forgetting.\n\n[Token-level prediction analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11509) can identify specific linguistic patterns where models struggle. This fine-grained analysis reveals weaknesses in handling rare vocabulary, complex syntax, or domain-specific terminology that aggregate perplexity figures might miss.\n\n[Galileo measures prompt perplexity](https://docs.galileo.ai/galileo/gen-ai-studio-products/galileo-guardrail-metrics/prompt-perplexity) across different text categories and domains, helping teams benchmark language understanding capabilities. Perplexity visualizations show performance trends over time and across model iterations, revealing when understanding improves or degrades for specific content types.\n\nLLM Performance Metric #4: Cross-Entropy\n----------------------------------------\n\nCross-entropy measures the difference between predicted token probability distributions and actual data distributions, providing a fundamental loss function for language model training and evaluation. Lower values indicate better alignment between model predictions and targets.\n\nUnlike perplexity, which reports an intuitive "branching factor," [cross-entropy](https://medium.com/ai-assimilating-intelligence/cross-entropy-in-large-language-models-llms-4f1c842b5fca) directly quantifies prediction error in bits. This makes it useful for comparing models across different tokenization schemes or vocabulary sizes where perplexity comparisons might mislead.\n\nToken-level cross-entropy analysis identifies specific vocabulary items or linguistic constructs where models show high uncertainty or consistent mispredictions. This granular measurement helps pinpoint weaknesses that might be addressed through architecture adjustments, data augmentation, or fine-tuning.\n\nFor production monitoring, track cross-entropy on representative samples over time to detect concept drift as real-world language evolves away from training data. Significant cross-entropy increases may signal the need for model retraining or fine-tuning on newer data.\n\nDomain adaptation progress can be precisely quantified through cross-entropy reduction on target-domain text. Establish domain-specific benchmarks and monitor improvements as adaptation techniques are applied, using these measurements to guide fine-tuning and data curation.\n\nWhile valuable for model development and evaluation, cross-entropy shares perplexity\'s limitations as a proxy for task-specific performance. Models with similar scores may show dramatically different capabilities on complex reasoning or creative generation challenges.\n\nGalileo provides detailed cross-entropy analysis tools to identify specific tokens and patterns where models struggle. Teams can track cross-entropy performance across model versions and data distributions, quickly detecting concept drift that indicates the need for model updates.\n\nLLM Performance Metric #5: Token Usage\n--------------------------------------\n\nToken usage measures the number of tokens processed during model inference, directly affecting operational costs and context window efficiency. For cloud-based LLM services charging per token, this translates directly to money spent.\n\nTrack both input and output tokens separately. Input token efficiency focuses on prompt engineering that achieves desired results with minimal prompt length. Output token efficiency measures how concisely the model generates responses while maintaining quality.\n\nContext window utilization shows the percentage of available token capacity used by a request. Models with fixed context windows (4K, 8K, or 16K tokens) must balance comprehensive context against token efficiency. Monitoring this helps identify opportunities for prompt compression or truncation.\n\nSet token budgets based on application economics and performance requirements. These budgets should inform prompt design guidelines, response length parameters, and retrieval strategies. Regular token usage audits can reveal inefficient patterns across workflows.\n\nAdvanced token optimization strategies include [prompt compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12968), [efficient few-shot example selection](https://medium.com/@stefansipinkoski/optimizing-ai-agents-with-dynamic-few-shot-prompting-585919f694cc), and dynamic response truncation. For knowledge-intensive applications, efficient retrieval mechanisms that provide only relevant context can significantly reduce token consumption.\n\nToken usage patterns often suggest opportunities for model rightsizing. Applications consistently using small portions of a large context window might benefit from smaller, more efficient models. Frequent context window saturation might indicate the need for models with larger capacities.\n\nGalileo provides detailed token usage analytics across prompts and responses, identifying inefficient patterns that drive up costs. Teams can analyze token consumption trends by application, user segment, or specific prompt types to optimize usage while maintaining response quality.\n\nLLM Performance Metric #6: Resource Utilization\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nResource utilization covers GPU/TPU computation, memory consumption, CPU usage, and storage requirements. These metrics influence infrastructure costs, deployment flexibility, and environmental impact through energy consumption.\n\nTrack both peak and sustained resource usage patterns. Peak memory usage determines minimum hardware requirements, while sustained computation patterns affect energy consumption and cooling needs. Many LLMs show spiky utilization with brief intensive computation followed by relative idleness.\n\nGPU memory efficiency deserves special attention as it frequently limits deployment options. Techniques like model quantization (converting weights from FP32 to INT8/FP16), [activation checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01792), and [gradient accumulation](https://medium.com/biased-algorithms/gradient-accumulation-in-pytorch-36962825fa44) can significantly reduce memory requirements without proportional performance drops.\n\nEstablish resource efficiency baselines to enable comparison across model versions and deployment configurations. These baselines help quantify optimization impact and identify unexpected resource consumption that might indicate inefficiencies or memory leaks.\n\nAdvanced monitoring should include hardware-specific metrics like GPU/TPU utilization percentage, memory bandwidth consumption, and thermal performance. These indicators help identify specific bottlenecks and guide hardware-aware optimization.\n\nFor multi-tenant deployments serving multiple applications or users, resource fairness and isolation metrics become essential. Monitoring per-tenant resource consumption helps ensure equitable service and prevents individual workloads from degrading system performance.\n\nGalileo tracks resource utilization metrics across compute resources, correlating usage patterns with specific workload types. Teams gain insights into which prompts or model configurations consume disproportionate resources, enabling targeted optimization of high-cost operations.\n\nLLM Performance Metric #7: Error Rates\n--------------------------------------\n\nError rates measure system reliability through metrics like request failures, timeouts, malformed outputs, and service disruptions. While traditional ML models might focus only on prediction errors, LLM systems need monitoring across the entire request lifecycle.\n\nCategorize failures into distinct types:\n\nError correlation analysis reveals patterns in failures, identifying specific inputs or conditions that trigger problems. Set error budgets defining acceptable reliability thresholds, with automated alerting when error rates approach critical levels.\n\nFor high-reliability applications, implement [circuit breaker patterns](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04313) and [graceful degradation strategies](https://medium.com/@mbneto/graceful-degradation-why-it-is-important-and-how-to-achieve-it-07f6d4a5f7d5) to maintain stability during partial failures. These might include fallback to simpler models, cached responses, or alternative processing when primary systems struggle.\n\nUse structured error logging with standardized formats capturing context information, model configurations, and environment details alongside error descriptions. This comprehensive logging enables efficient debugging and root-cause analysis.\n\nInclude synthetic testing with adversarial inputs specifically designed to trigger system failures. These "chaos engineering" approaches proactively identify weaknesses before they impact users, enabling preemptive fixes rather than reactive responses.\n\nGalileo\'s error detection capabilities automatically identify different error types across requests, categorizing failures, and tracking error rates over time. Teams can drill into specific error patterns, understand triggering conditions, and set automated alerts for rapid remediation.\n\nEnhance Your LLM Performance with Galileo\n-----------------------------------------\n\nComprehensive LLM performance evaluation requires integrating multiple approaches into a coherent framework addressing both technical performance and business requirements.

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ["## Challenges in Benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nBenchmarking is a critical process in assessing the performance of large language models (LLMs), as it allows researchers and practitioners to compare various models against standardized metrics to evaluate their efficiency, accuracy, and overall effectiveness. However, this process is fraught with significant challenges that can undermine the reliability of the benchmarking results. This section explores the common challenges faced during the benchmarking of LLMs, discusses the limitations of current benchmarks, and proposes recommendations for future assessments.\n\n### Common Challenges in Benchmarking LLMs\n\n#### 1. Biases in Data\nA prominent challenge in benchmarking LLMs is the presence of biases in the datasets used for training. LLMs are typically trained on extensive corpora that may reflect societal biases related to gender, race, and ethnicity. For example, if a language model is predominantly trained on texts authored by male writers, it may generate outputs that favor male-related terminology, leading to biased evaluations that do not accurately reflect the model's capabilities across diverse demographics. Such biases can skew performance metrics and create misleading conclusions about a model's generalizability.\n\n#### 2. Variability in Evaluation Results\nThe variability in LLM performance can be attributed to differences in evaluation methodology and the specific benchmarks employed. Various metrics—ranging from accuracy and F1 scores to BLEU scores—can yield conflicting results for the same model. Additionally, the stochastic nature of training and evaluation processes (e.g., random seed initialization) introduces variability that complicates the assessment of model performance. This inconsistency makes it challenging to draw definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of a model.\n\n#### 3. Lack of Standardization\nCurrently, there is no universally accepted standard for benchmarking LLMs, resulting in a proliferation of diverse benchmark datasets and evaluation frameworks. This lack of standardization complicates comparisons across models and can obscure genuine advancements in model performance. Researchers may find it difficult to determine which model performs best when evaluations are based on varying methodologies, leading to confusion and potential misinterpretations of results.\n\n#### 4. Contextual Limitations\nStandard benchmarks often fail to encapsulate the contextual nuances required for effective evaluations of LLMs. While models may excel in structured tasks, they may struggle with more ambiguous or open-ended queries. As a result, benchmarks that do not account for real-world applications can lead to an overestimation of a model's capabilities, as they may perform well on benchmarks yet falter in practical scenarios.\n\n#### 5. Diversity of Tasks\nLLMs are applied across a wide array of tasks, each with distinct requirements and evaluation criteria. Tasks can range from basic text generation to complex functions like summarization and commonsense reasoning. This diversity complicates the creation of benchmarks that encompass all aspects of LLM capabilities, as each task demands its own evaluation parameters. For instance, benchmarks for text generation may prioritize creativity, while those for translation might emphasize accuracy and fluency.\n\n#### 6. Dynamic Nature of Language\nLanguage is inherently dynamic, with new slang, terminology, and usage patterns emerging continuously. This evolving nature poses challenges for static benchmarks, which may become outdated and fail to capture contemporary linguistic developments. Benchmarks must be adaptable to remain relevant and ensure that LLMs maintain effectiveness in their outputs.\n\n### Limitations of Current Benchmarks\n\n#### 1. Overreliance on Static Benchmarks\nMany existing benchmarks are static and do not evolve alongside changes in language and societal norms. As LLMs improve, static benchmarks can hinder the discovery of new skills and capabilities, leading to a restricted scope of evaluation. Once a model masters a benchmark, it may no longer provide meaningful assessments of its evolving capabilities.\n\n#### 2. Insufficient Diversity of Evaluation Tasks\nCurrent benchmarks often focus on a narrow set of tasks that may not represent the full range of language processing capabilities. This limited scope can overlook new or unexpected skills that LLMs may develop. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation, benchmarks should incorporate diverse tasks that challenge models in various ways, including creative writing and real-time conversational capabilities.\n\n#### 3. Evaluation Metrics\nSelecting appropriate evaluation metrics for LLMs is a complex challenge. Traditional metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, BLEU, and ROUGE are commonly used but often fail to capture the nuanced aspects of language understanding and generation. For instance, BLEU and ROUGE scores may not accurately reflect semantic correctness or contextual appropriateness. There is a pressing need for more sophisticated evaluation methods that encompass qualitative factors alongside quantitative measures.\n\n#### 4. Cognitive Biases in Evaluation\nCognitive biases inherent in LLMs can skew evaluations. Models may exhibit tendencies such as egocentrism (favoring self-generated content) or salience bias (favoring longer responses), which can distort their assessments of outputs. Research has indicated that many models display strong biases, raising concerns about their reliability as evaluators.\n\n### Recommendations for Future Assessments\n\n#### 1. Developing Adaptive Benchmarks\nTo address the challenges of benchmarking LLMs, it is essential to create adaptive benchmarks that evolve with the changing nature of language and its applications. These benchmarks should incorporate diverse datasets that reflect a broad range of languages, dialects, and cultural contexts, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation that captures the linguistic diversity of real-world applications.\n\n#### 2. Improving Evaluation Metrics\nExisting evaluation metrics should be refined to better capture qualitative aspects of LLM performance. This includes developing metrics that assess contextual relevance, coherence, and creativity, alongside traditional quantitative measures. Such improvements can enhance the accuracy and reliability of performance assessments.\n\n#### 3. Addressing Biases\nIntegrating bias testing into the benchmarking process is crucial for ensuring that LLMs operate fairly across different demographics. This can involve utilizing representative datasets and implementing measures to identify and correct biases in model outputs.\n\n#### 4. Establishing Standardized Protocols\nDeveloping standardized protocols for benchmark implementation can enhance consistency and reliability across evaluations. Guidelines for creating benchmarks that account for diverse linguistic and cultural perspectives can help maintain objectivity and representation in evaluations.\n\n#### 5. Regular Audits and Updates\nBenchmarks should undergo regular audits and updates to remain relevant. Continuous monitoring of model performance and alignment with societal values can help mitigate biases and ensure that benchmarks reflect the complexities of real-world applications. Implementing a feedback loop from users can further enhance the relevance and impact of benchmarks.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, limitations, and incorporating the recommended improvements, the research community can cultivate a more robust and equitable framework for the benchmarking of LLMs. This will ultimately lead to more reliable and responsible AI applications that are better aligned with societal needs and expectations."], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='common challenges in benchmarking LLMs data biases variability evaluation results'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://www.honeyhive.ai/post/avoiding-common-pitfalls-in-llm-evaluation', title='Avoiding Common Pitfalls in LLM Evaluation - HoneyHive', raw_content='Published Time: Thu, 07 Aug 2025 23:17:30 GMT\n\nAvoiding Common Pitfalls in LLM Evaluation\n\n===============\n\n[![Image 1](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626c95_63f13bee638d6993e08555fb_logo2.png)](https://www.honeyhive.ai/)\n\nPlatform\n\n![Image 2](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65a4b26bc64d1938805c363d_image%20(226).png)\n\n![Image 3](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626d04_data-analytics.png)[Observability](https://www.honeyhive.ai/observability)\n\n![Image 4](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626d01_computer.png)[Prompts](https://www.honeyhive.ai/playground)\n\n![Image 5](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626d02_check-list.png)[Evaluation](https://www.honeyhive.ai/evaluation)\n\n![Image 6](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c4e/65483e3a00a324531a626d03_database%20(1).png)[Datasets](https://www.honeyhive.ai/datasets)\n\n[Pricing](https://www.honeyhive.ai/pricing)[Careers](https://careers.honeyhive.ai/)[Blog](https://www.honeyhive.ai/blog)[Docs](https://docs.honeyhive.ai/introduction)\n\n[Log in](https://app.honeyhive.ai/)[Sign up](https://app.honeyhive.ai/)\n\n[Back to blog](https://www.honeyhive.ai/blog)\nMay 20, 2025\n\nAvoiding Common Pitfalls in LLM Evaluation\n==========================================\n\nDiscover the hidden challenges of LLM evaluation and the most common mistakes we\'ve seen after helping hundreds of teams build effective evals that drive business results.\n\n![Image 7](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681cfaa2bd9349d8acf2f87a_image%20(406).png)\n\nBuilding a successful LLM product depends on knowing how well it performs. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts here - relying on a single score from the latest LLM benchmark won’t magically improve your application. It\'s increasingly clear the path to a successful AI product is built on carefully curated evaluations, rapid iterations, and a clear understanding of the limitations of different evaluation methods and when to use them.\n\n\u200d\n\nBefore discussing the limitations and pitfalls of LLM evaluation, it’s important to distinguish between two related but distinct types of evaluations. There’s a fundamental difference between standardized, public benchmarks designed to measure general model capabilities and the custom, application-specific evaluations that determine whether a system actually meets your needs.\n\n\u200d\n\nIn this post, we’ll clarify the distinction between standardized LLM benchmarks and application-specific evals, and explore some of the most common pitfalls that teams encounter when interpreting eval results. Along the way, we’ll discuss why high leaderboard scores don’t always translate to real-world readiness, the challenges of using LLM-as-a-judge, the importance of statistical rigor at different stages of evaluation, and the need for continuous, evolving evals as your product and users change. By understanding these issues, you’ll be better equipped to design evaluation processes that align with your goals and avoid common traps that we’ve seen teams run into.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n#### Standardized Benchmarks vs. Application-Specific Evals\n\n\u200d\n\nWhen discussing benchmarks in the context of LLMs, we often refer to two related but distinct concepts: **Standardized Model Benchmarks** and **Application-Specific Evals**. These serve different purposes and have different implications for model development and deployment. Before addressing common misconceptions about LLM benchmarks, it’s important to distinguish between these two types. Throughout the following sections, we will specify which type of benchmark we are referencing whenever the distinction is relevant.\n\n\u200d\n\n![Image 8](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681bccfb7fd515d63fdce456_Captura%20de%20tela%202025-04-30%20171307.png)\n\n_Standardized benchmarks test the core model’s general skills, while application-specific evaluations measure how the whole system performs on real tasks that matter to users._\n\n\u200d\n\n**Standardized LLM Benchmarks** — like MMLU, GLUE, or HellaSwag - are shared, public datasets and tasks designed to measure the general capabilities of a core language model across a wide range of knowledge domains and skills. Their primary purpose is to enable fair comparisons between different foundation models and to track overall progress in the field. However, these benchmarks have significant limitations: they can suffer from data contamination (where test data leaks into training), may not reflect performance on the specific tasks that matter for your application, and can sometimes be “gamed” by optimizing models for benchmark performance rather than real-world utility.\n\n\u200d\n\n**Application-Specific Evals** — in contrast, are tailored to the needs of a particular application or compound AI system. Rather than focusing on the core model in isolation, these evaluations measure how the entire system - including prompts, retrieval components, agents, and other integrations - performs on tasks directly relevant to the intended use case and the surrounding business logic. The goal here is not to compare models in the abstract, but to ensure the system meets user and business needs, uncover specific failure modes, and guide ongoing iterations. Application-specific evals often start small and curated, evolving and blending quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments to capture the nuances of real-world performance.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Common Pitfalls in LLM Evaluation**\n\n\u200d\n\nWith that in mind, let\'s examine some common misconceptions and pitfalls when interpreting benchmark results and discuss how to approach evaluation in a way that aligns with your goals and use cases.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n##### **Mistaking Benchmark Scores for Real-World Readiness**\n\nIt\'s tempting to assume that high scores on standardized benchmarks automatically translate to good performance in real-world applications. However, a high score on a public benchmark doesn\'t guarantee that simply switching models will significantly improve your application performance. LLM Benchmarks are designed to measure the general capabilities of the core language model across a wide range of knowledge domains or reasoning tasks. While they help compare foundation models and track overall progress in the field, they come with significant limitations. For one, benchmarks can suffer from data contamination, where models have seen parts of the test set during training, artificially inflating their scores.\n\n\u200d\n\nIt\'s also important to mention the issue of benchmark saturation - as LLMs become more capable, it\'s not uncommon for the top ranks at a given benchmark to reach close to perfect scores. When this happens, the benchmark loses its usefulness, as it can no longer differentiate one model from the other. This is already the case for multiple benchmarks, such as HumanEval [1] and GSM8K [2], with the top models reaching over 90% overall performance. Benchmark saturation leads to the continuous need to release newer and harder versions for the saturated benchmarks or search other more challenging datasets.\n\n\u200d\n\nRelying solely on these scores can lead to a false sense of security. A model that excels on a leaderboard may still stumble when faced with the messy, context-rich, and often ambiguous scenarios encountered in production. This is especially true when moving from evaluating the core LLM to assessing the entire system\'s performance, including prompts, retrieval components, agents, and other integrations.\n\n\u200d\n\nRecent research highlights how leaderboard scores can be systematically distorted by selective reporting, private test sets, and unequal access to data[3]. In practice, high rankings may reflect overfitting to the benchmark rather than genuine improvements in real-world capability.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n##### **A single score isn’t enough**\n\nPerhaps the most crucial aspect to consider is that you need more than a single benchmark score to act and improve upon your application. A real-world system often involves different model capabilities applied to a specific domain and other interactions with external tools, so replacing your current model with a possibly better one is usually just the start of your improvement process. Let\'s take an example of a recipe and nutrition system, where a user could ask things like:\n\n\u200d\n\n"_I’m looking for a healthy vegetarian dinner recipe that uses sweet potatoes and spinach. I’d like something under 500 calories per serving, and I’m allergic to nuts. Can you find a recipe for me, tell me the ingredients, and estimate the calories per serving?”_\n\n\u200d\n\nA higher score in a general reading comprehension benchmark doesn\'t tell you how the model will behave in context with all the remaining moving parts of your system. To do so, you need to decompose your system into smaller tasks. In this simple example, maybe this could mean something like:\n\n\u200d\n\nIs the system calling the web search API with the proper query, based on the user prompt?\n\n\u200d\n\n1.   Is the system calling the web search API with the proper query, based on the user prompt?\n2.   Is the web search returning relevant recipes?\n3.   Are we selecting the best recipe out of all retrieved recipes?\n4.   Did the system accurately extract data such as ingredients, quantities, and preparation steps into a structured JSON?\n5.   Did the system correctly estimate the calories and other nutrition information from the structured data?\n6.   Did the system correctly adapt the recipe according to the user\'s restrictions/preferences?\n7.   Did the system correctly deliver a final recipe to the user?\n\n\u200d\n\n![Image 9](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681bcd5b502b7487fd7d034d_Captura%20de%20tela%202025-05-06%20153408.png)\n\nA complex system, like a recipe and nutrition assistant, requires evaluation at each step. Only by breaking down and assessing each component can you identify where improvements are needed, rather than relying on a single overall benchmark score.\n\n\u200d\n\nIf only evaluating the final step, you won’t know why the response was unsuccessful - did we not retrieve the correct documents, was the ingredients parsing off, or perhaps we failed to adjust the recipe, even if all the upstream processes were correct? More granular evals mean more actionable insights to improve your system. Ultimately, while standardized benchmarks are a valuable tool, they are not a substitute for application-specific evals.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n##### Overlooking the Limits of LLM-Based Evaluation\n\nUsing LLMs as judges is attractive for several reasons. Unlike traditional metrics that require human-written reference texts, LLM judges can directly evaluate open-ended outputs, making it possible to assess tasks where references are scarce or subjective. LLM-based evaluation also scales far beyond what\'s feasible with human annotators, dramatically reducing costs and turnaround time.\n\n\u200d\n\nRecent studies have shown that, in some cases, generalist LLMs can achieve high alignment with human evaluators, especially when using advanced models and carefully crafted evaluation prompts [4, 5]. This has led to growing enthusiasm for automating evaluation pipelines with LLMs in the loop.\n\n\u200d\n\nHowever, it\'s essential to recognize this approach\'s limitations and potential pitfalls. First, if you use generalist LLMs through APIs, changes to the underlying models are often opaque, hurting the reproducibility of evaluation results. Second, the design of the evaluation process itself is critical.\n\n\u200d\n\n###### Designing your evaluation process\n\n\u200d\n\nAchieving reliable results requires careful prompt engineering and clear, unambiguous evaluation criteria. This will require some experimentation for your particular use case, but here are some general recommendations for designing your evaluation prompt:\n\n\u200d\n\n1.   Provide a clear definition of your task, evaluation criteria, and adopted scale.\n2.   Don’t boil the ocean with a single LLM-as-a-judge call that evaluates multiple criteria; instead, break it down into multiple yes/no type evals.\n3.   A Likert scale, such as asking the LLM to output a score between 1 and 5, can be confusing to interpret. When possible, prefer binary pass/fail judgements, which are easier to interpret and align with human judgement [6].\n4.   Adding few-shot examples of questions in your evaluation prompt can improve your results, like in other LLM tasks.\n5.   Studies have shown that pairwise comparisons have better correlations with human preferences than direct scoring, for example, asking the judge to “_Evaluate and compare the coherence of the two following summaries,_” rather than asking it to “_Evaluate the coherence of the following summary_ ” [7].\n6.   As in other LLM tasks, chain-of-thought style reasoning can improve performance by asking the model to output its reasoning before generating the score [8].\n\n\u200d\n\n###### Evaluate your evaluators\n\n\u200d\n\nCrucially, it\'s essential to evaluate your evaluators. To do so, the role of the domain expert is key, so you can always have a baseline to compare your evaluator\'s outputs to. This is also helpful in tuning your evaluation prompt, as this process is very circular - you need clear evaluation criteria to be able to grade your outputs, but the act of grading helps you more clearly define those criteria [9]. You don\'t need your domain expert to evaluate all the outputs judged by your evaluator, which would defeat the purpose of using LLMs as a judge, but you can curate a sample of representative examples, and use it to align your automated judge with your baseline continuously. Based on the overall agreement, you can tweak your judge\'s different parameters, as seen in the previous section, and iterate on your experiments to improve the correlation. Don\'t expect it to reach 100%, though - LLMs are stochastic, and so are humans.\n\n\u200d\n\nEvaluating your evaluators is an ongoing process, so it\'s essential to set up a process that facilitates your domain expert\'s collaboration. For example, it should be easy to browse through the examples, all the required information should be centralized, and the annotations should be easily discoverable by the rest of the team.\n\n\u200d\n\n###### Other limitations and biases\n\n\u200d\n\nLLM judges also inherit the well-known limitations of LLMs in general. They can hallucinate, make factual errors, or struggle to follow complex instructions- issues that can directly impact the quality and reliability of their evaluations. Studies have found that LLM judges may exhibit systematic biases, such as favoring LLM-generated outputs over high-quality human-written text [4], or assigning scores that diverge significantly from those given by human annotators, even on relatively simple tasks[5]. This is not an exhaustive list - the table below illustrates additional biases that can influence evaluation outcomes.\n\n\u200d\n\n![Image 10](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681bcd908ec58b8f900a8cda_Captura%20de%20tela%202025-05-06%20181342.png)\n\nDefinitions of different cognitive biases, with examples. Source: Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators [10].\n\n\u200d\n\nIn short, LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a powerful tool for scaling up assessment and reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Still, it is not a perfect substitute for human judgment. Over-reliance on automated evaluation can mask important failure modes, introduce new biases, and ultimately lead to overconfidence in system performance. Human-in-the-loop evaluation remains essential for critical applications, and LLM-based judgments should always be interpreted with appropriate caution and context.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n##### Misapplying Statistical Rigor Across Evaluation Stages\n\nWhen evaluating LLMs, it’s essential to recognize that not all evaluation stages require the same level of statistical rigor. The goals and appropriate methods differ depending on whether you\'re running quick, custom tests, or reporting results from standardized benchmarks.\n\n\u200d\n\nIn early-stage, custom evaluations, it\'s common - and often necessary - to work with small, hand-picked datasets. Here, the goal is to identify failure modes, spot qualitative issues, or iterate quickly on model behavior. Demanding strict statistical significance at this stage can be counterproductive, as the focus is on exploration rather than precise measurement. For example, if you\'re just trying to find out whether your model can handle a new type of prompt, running a handful of examples is often enough to guide further development.\n\n\u200d\n\nHowever, the need for statistical rigor increases as evaluations mature, especially when comparing models or reporting results on standardized benchmarks. Here, the goal shifts to making reliable, quantitative claims about model performance. This is where issues like dataset size, the number of evaluation runs, and the inherent non-determinism of LLMs become critical. LLMs can produce different outputs for the same input due to their probabilistic nature, so results from a single run or a small dataset may not reflect true performance. Without sufficient data or repeated measurements, you risk being misled by random fluctuations - a classic case of "the curse of small numbers" [11].\n\n\u200d\n\nIt\'s also important to recognize that the transition from qualitative to quantitative evaluation is not a sharp line, but depends on your goals, the maturity of your system, and the decisions you intend to make based on the results. For instance, if you\'re deciding whether to ship a new model version based on benchmark results, statistical rigor is essential. But a handful of examples may suffice if you\'re just trying to identify new error types.\n\n\u200d\n\nThe main pitfall is either demanding statistical significance too early, wasting effort on exploratory tests, or failing to apply it when it matters, leading to unreliable or misleading comparisons. Understanding the purpose of your evaluation at each stage helps avoid both traps.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **The Case for Continuous Evaluation**\n\n\u200d\n\nA common pitfall in LLM benchmarking is treating custom evaluation as a one-time task, relying on static offline datasets that quickly become outdated as your product and its users evolve. The real world is a very dynamic environment; along with it, your users\' behaviors also change over time. That means your input data experience distribution shifts, usage patterns change, user expectations evolve, and new failure modes emerge. The direct consequence is that your evaluation dataset must accompany this shift. Otherwise, it will fail to catch regressions and miss new vulnerabilities. This phenomenon is known as **Dataset Drift**, but it\'s also not the only type of drift you should be aware of.\n\n\u200d\n\nNot only should your dataset be continuously updated, but your evaluation criteria also evolve with time. To grade your outputs, you need clear evaluation criteria, but the process of grading often helps you to iterate and improve on your evaluation criteria. In the paper by [Shankar et al., “Who Validates the Validators?"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12272), it was observed that, when grading the outputs of LLM-as-a-judge evaluators, human graders would often refine their criteria when observing new types of incorrect LLM outputs, or adjust the criteria to fit better the LLMs behavior, which they call **Criteria Drift**.\n\n\u200d\n\nThe bottom line is that you need to continuously iterate on your evaluations, updating your datasets and refining your evaluation criteria. Your evals should be treated as living documents, regularly updated in response to observed failures, changing requirements, and new user interactions. Here are some general recommendations:\n\n\u200d\n\n1.   Incorporate insights from production: Log your interactions, curate and label interesting or problematic cases, and feed them back into your evaluation datasets.\n2.   Continuously measure the alignment of your automated evaluators against domain expert critiques to improve your evaluators over time.\n3.   Iterate on your LLM evaluator prompts/evaluation criteria and test them against your evaluation datasets.\n4.   Given the sheer volume of production data, running evaluations on a sample of your data can be helpful, especially when using LLM-as-a-judge metrics or human evaluation, where costs can become prohibitive.\n\n\u200d\n\nThe most effective evaluation processes close the loop between offline and online data, creating a continuous feedback cycle. This ongoing iteration ensures that your benchmarks remain relevant and your system is tested against the real challenges it faces in the wild. The insights and visibility gained from your tuned custom evals will guide you on what changes you need to make to improve your application, be it fine-tuning your models, changing your prompts, or adjusting any other step in your pipeline.\n\n\u200d\n\n![Image 11](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65483e3a00a324531a626c07/681bcdae5d45ff0cc165d7af_Captura%20de%20tela%202025-05-06%20183313.png)\n\nIllustration of the continuous evaluation cycle: as user behavior and product requirements evolve, your custom evals must be regularly updated to catch regressions, address new failure modes, and ensure benchmarks remain relevant in dynamic real-world environments.\n\n\u200d\n\nThe most successful LLM teams treat evaluation as a living, iterative practice. They blend quantitative and qualitative methods, continuously update their test sets with real user data, and maintain a healthy skepticism toward any single metric or approach. By grounding your evaluation strategy in the realities of your application and remaining vigilant to new challenges as they arise, you can build LLM systems that are impressive on paper and truly robust, reliable, and valuable in the hands of your users.\n\n\u200d\n\n#### References\n\n1.

Dynamic frameworks and emerging trends drive robust, adaptive AI performance, ensuring safer, efficient deployment in sensitive fields like healthcare, finance, and law.\n\n#### [PremAI](/author/premai/)\n\n• 10 min read\n\nIn the dynamic field of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cornerstone of technological innovation, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across domains such as natural language understanding, reasoning, and creative text generation. The evaluation of these models has become increasingly critical, not just for understanding their performance but also for ensuring their safe deployment in real-world applications.\n\nThe evolution of LLM evaluation methodologies parallels the rapid advancements in their design. Early approaches relied on task-specific benchmarks like [GLUE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08073?ref=blog.premai.io) and [SuperGLUE](https://klu.ai/glossary/superglue-eval?ref=blog.premai.io) to assess isolated capabilities such as syntactic parsing and question answering. However, with the advent of models like [GPT-3](https://openai.com/index/gpt-3-apps/?ref=blog.premai.io), ChatGPT, and [GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/?ref=blog.premai.io), evaluation frameworks have expanded to accommodate complex, multi-faceted performance dimensions.\n\n[Key motivations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19736?ref=blog.premai.io) for evaluating LLMs include:\n\n1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Ensuring models meet task-specific requirements across diverse applications.\n2. **Safety and Trustworthiness**: Addressing concerns such as data privacy, toxicity, and misinformation to mitigate societal risks.\n3. **Alignment and Ethics**: Aligning model outputs with human values and minimizing biases.\n\nCurrent research underscores the importance of developing robust, adaptive evaluation frameworks that address these goals. The growing integration of LLMs into sensitive domains like healthcare, law, and finance further emphasizes the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluations.\n\n## **Objectives of LLM Evaluation**\n\nEvaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) serves multiple critical objectives, each essential for ensuring their effective deployment and integration into real-world systems. As these models are increasingly embedded in sensitive applications such as healthcare, law, and finance, rigorous evaluation becomes paramount. The key objectives of LLM evaluation include:\n\n#### **1. Performance Benchmarking**\n\n* **Definition**: Benchmarking aims to quantify an LLM's performance across diverse tasks, such as language understanding, reasoning, and generation.\n* **Examples**: Metrics like accuracy, perplexity, and F1 scores help evaluate language comprehension and fluency.\n* **Impact**: This enables developers to compare models, select optimal architectures, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n#### **2. Understanding Limitations**\n\n* **Challenges Addressed**: Identifying model weaknesses such as hallucination, factual inaccuracies, or poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data.\n* **Strategies**:\n  + Using datasets like [AdvGLUE](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/advglue?ref=blog.premai.io) for adversarial robustness testing.\n  + Employing benchmarks such as GLUE-Xfor OOD performance.\n* **Outcome**: Clear insights into scenarios where models may fail, enabling risk mitigation.\n\n#### **3. Ensuring Safety and Trustworthiness**\n\n* **Focus Areas**:\n  + Avoidance of harmful outputs, such as bias, toxicity, and misinformation.\n  + Protection against adversarial attacks and robustness to perturbations in input data.\n* **Benchmarks**:\n  + Safety-specific datasets (e.g., RealToxicityPrompts, [AdvGLUE](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/advglue?ref=blog.premai.io)).\n  + Comprehensive evaluations of alignment with ethical norms and human values.\n\n#### **4. Alignment with Human Values**\n\n* **Purpose**: Evaluating how closely the outputs of LLMs align with societal and ethical expectations.\n* **Challenges**:\n  + Detecting bias and stereotypes using datasets like [StereoSet](https://github.com/moinnadeem/StereoSet?ref=blog.premai.io) and [CrowS-Pairs](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/crows-pairs?ref=blog.premai.io).\n  + Measuring ethical alignment with frameworks such as ETHICS.\n* **Goal**: To develop systems that are inclusive, unbiased, and adaptable to diverse cultural contexts.\n\n#### **5. Risk Mitigation in Deployment**\n\n* **Why Important**:\n  + Mitigating risks such as data leakage, system manipulation, or operational failures.\n* **Evaluation Tools**:\n  + Red-teaming methods to probe for vulnerabilities.\n  + Robustness metrics to measure stability under adversarial conditions.\n* **Real-World Example**: Testing ChatGPT's ability to handle medical and legal queries without propagating misinformation.\n\nBy fulfilling these objectives, LLM evaluations ensure not only technical excellence but also societal trust and safety, laying the groundwork for responsible AI deployment across industries.\n\n## **Dimensions of LLM Evaluation**\n\nUnderstanding the dimensions of LLM evaluation is critical to designing robust benchmarks and protocols that align with their evolving capabilities and use cases. The key dimensions encompass the **what**, **where**, and **how** of evaluation, which provide a structured framework for assessing LLM performance across diverse domains and tasks.\n\n### **1. What to Evaluate**\n\n* **General Capabilities**: These include tasks such as natural language understanding, reasoning, and natural language generation. Evaluations often measure fluency, coherence, and contextual relevance of responses. [MSTEMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01448?ref=blog.premai.io), for example, introduces out-of-distribution (OOD) semantic templates to rigorously test these aspects.\n* **Domain-Specific Capabilities**: Performance tailored to specialized domains, such as legal, medical, or financial sectors, is critical. Benchmarks like PubMedQA and LSAT are specifically designed for these settings.\n* **Safety and Ethical Considerations**: Assessments of bias, toxicity, and alignment with human values are essential for ensuring trustworthy deployment. Tools like RealToxicityPrompts and StereoSet are commonly used in this area.\n\n### **2. Where to Evaluate**\n\n* **Standardized Benchmarks**: Datasets like GLUE, [SuperGLUE](https://klu.ai/glossary/superglue-eval?ref=blog.premai.io), and Big-Bench have been central to assessing general capabilities. However, their static nature may limit their ability to test adaptive performance.\n* **Dynamic Frameworks**: Advanced tools like [DYVAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17167?ref=blog.premai.io) and [MSTEMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01448?ref=blog.premai.io) emphasize generating dynamic, OOD datasets to evaluate robustness and adaptability. This approach addresses limitations of static benchmarks by introducing variability in input styles and semantics.\n\n---\n\n### **3. How to Evaluate**\n\n* **Static Metrics**: Conventional metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and perplexity measure baseline performance. However, they may not capture nuances like contextual relevance or user alignment.\n* **Dynamic Approaches**: Evaluation tools like PandaLM integrate dynamic benchmarks to test models under varying conditions, including adversarial scenarios.\n* **Human and Model Scoring**: Human evaluators often provide qualitative insights into coherence and alignment, whereas automated evaluators (e.g., [GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/?ref=blog.premai.io) as a scoring model) offer scalability and cost-efficiency.\n\n---\n\nBy combining insights from standardized benchmarks and emerging dynamic frameworks, LLM evaluation can achieve a balance between scalability, depth, and adaptability.\n\n## **Current Evaluation Strategies**\n\n  \n\nEvaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) involves a range of strategies that address various performance dimensions, from basic accuracy to robustness under adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. This section outlines the current methodologies for evaluating LLMs, emphasizing the evolution from static benchmarks to adaptive, dynamic evaluation frameworks.\n\n#### **1. Static Benchmarks**\n\n* **Definition**: Static benchmarks consist of pre-defined datasets that evaluate specific capabilities of LLMs, such as natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation. Examples include GLUE, [SuperGLUE](https://klu.ai/glossary/superglue-eval?ref=blog.premai.io), and MMLU.\n* **Challenges**:\n  + **Data Contamination**: Static datasets often overlap with training data, leading to inflated evaluation metrics.\n  + **Limited Robustness Testing**: These benchmarks struggle to test real-world adaptability, including adversarial inputs or OOD generalization.\n* **Examples**:\n  + **GLUE**: A multi-task benchmark for natural language understanding.\n  + [**SuperGLUE**](https://klu.ai/glossary/superglue-eval?ref=blog.premai.io): An improved version of GLUE with more challenging tasks.\n\n#### **2. Dynamic Evaluation**\n\n* **Overview**: Dynamic evaluations adapt test conditions to better assess model robustness and contextual understanding.\n* **Frameworks**:\n  + [**DYVAL**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17167?ref=blog.premai.io): Focuses on reasoning tasks by introducing dynamic test scenarios.\n  + [**PandaLM**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05087?ref=blog.premai.io): An adaptive framework optimizing evaluation for instruction-tuned models. It incorporates subjective metrics such as conciseness and clarity, moving beyond traditional accuracy scores.\n* **Advantages**:\n  + **Improved Robustness**: Dynamic evaluation exposes models to diverse and unpredictable test cases.\n  + **Reduced Bias**: Incorporates human-like subjectivity for a more comprehensive assessment.\n\n#### **3. Adversarial and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Testing**\n\n* **Adversarial Testing**:\n  + Focuses on evaluating models under intentional input distortions (e.g., typographical errors, sentence-level distractions).\n  + Tools like [AdvGLUE](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/advglue?ref=blog.premai.io) assess adversarial robustness by introducing text perturbations.\n* **OOD Testing**:\n  + Evaluates how well models perform on data outside their training distribution.\n  + Benchmarks like Flipkart and DDXPlus are used to test real-world applicability.\n\n#### **4. Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation**\n\n* **Definition**: Combines automated metrics with human judgment to evaluate subjective qualities like coherence, alignment, and ethical considerations.\n* **Applications**:\n  + Used in frameworks like [PandaLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05087?ref=blog.premai.io), where human annotations validate automated assessments.\n  + Reduces reliance on static accuracy metrics by considering qualitative feedback.\n\n#### **5. Emerging Trends**\n\n* **Hybrid Approaches**:\n  + Combining static and dynamic evaluations to balance scalability and depth.\n  + Leveraging adaptive frameworks like [PandaLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05087?ref=blog.premai.io) for automated, scalable evaluations.\n* **Real-World Testing**:\n  + Incorporating domain-specific datasets (e.g., PubMedQA, LSAT) to simulate practical applications.\n\nThese strategies illustrate the shift towards more nuanced and adaptive evaluation methodologies, ensuring LLMs meet the complex demands of real-world deployment.\n\n## **Emerging Trends and Benchmarks**\n\n  \n\nThe field of LLM evaluation is rapidly evolving, with new trends and benchmarks emerging to address the growing complexity and diverse applications of these models.

This comprehensive evaluation process is essential for leveraging the full potential of [generative AI](/insights/ai-and-machine-learning/the-generative-ai-technology-stack) in business applications.\n\n## Challenges and limitations of LLM benchmarking\n\nOne significant challenge is the dynamic nature of language itself, which can lead to benchmarks that quickly become outdated as language use evolves. Additionally, due to the complexity and diversity of tasks that LLMs are expected to perform, no single benchmark can adequately capture a model's overall capabilities. This necessitates a suite of benchmarks to evaluate different aspects of LLM performance comprehensively.\n\nBenchmarking methodologies can also introduce biases and pitfalls that skew the evaluation of LLMs. For instance, benchmarks might favor models trained on specific types of data or those optimized for particular metrics, such as accuracy, at the expense of other important factors, like fairness or robustness. Recognizing and addressing these biases is essential for objective and reliable model comparisons. This involves designing benchmarks that are inclusive and representative of the diverse range of tasks and contexts in which LLMs operate.\n\nEnsuring fair and reliable comparisons among different LLMs requires a standardized approach to benchmarking. Variations in how models are tested and evaluated can lead to inconsistent and misleading results. Establishing common benchmarking protocols and metrics allows for more accurate comparisons, facilitating the identification of the most effective models for specific applications. This standardization is a critical step toward advancing the field of LLMs and maximizing their utility in real-world applications.\n\n## Best practices for LLM benchmarking\n\nBest practices in LLM benchmarking are vital for achieving accurate and reliable results. Carefully select benchmarks relevant to the specific tasks the LLM will perform to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the model's capabilities. Use diverse datasets to test the model across a wide range of scenarios, minimizing the risk of bias and ensuring the model's robustness and versatility.\n\nCreate standardized frameworks for LLM evaluation to significantly enhance the benchmarking process. Frameworks provide consistent guidelines for conducting benchmarks, analyzing results, and reporting findings. They facilitate comparisons across different LLMs by ensuring that all models are evaluated under the same conditions and according to the same criteria. Standardized frameworks also help with identifying areas where models excel or need improvement, guiding future development efforts.\n\nCollaboration among experts in the field is necessary for establishing and refining benchmarking standards.

GSM8K consists of 8.5K high-quality, linguistically diverse math word problems designed to evaluate models' ability to answer basic mathematical questions that involve multi-step reasoning.\n\n# Limitations of LLM Benchmarks\n\nThere are two major limitations of current LLM benchmarks:\n\n**1. Restricted scope**\n\nMany benchmarks have restricted scope, usually targeting capabilities on which LLMs have already proven some proficiency. Because they focus on areas where language models are known to be good, they're not great at finding new or unexpected skills that may emerge as language models get more advanced.\n\n**2. Short life span**\n\nAlso, benchmarks for language modeling often don't last long in terms of usefulness. Once language models reach a level of performance that's as good as humans on these benchmarks, the benchmarks are typically either stopped and swapped out or updated by adding harder challenges.\n\nThis short lifespan is likely because these benchmarks don't cover tasks that are much harder than what current language models can do.\n\nIt’s clear that as models continue to improve, they will achieve increasingly similar and higher scores on current benchmarks. So, we'll need to test models on future capabilities that are not possible now - with benchmarks like BBHard.\n\n\u200d\n\n# Testing Future Potential\n\n**BigBench - Predicting future potential**\n\n[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04615.pdf) | [dataset](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench?tab=readme-ov-file) [released 2023]\n\nBIG-bench is created to test the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models, and to understand how those capabilities and limitations are likely to change as models are improved.\n\nThis evaluation currently consists of 204 tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. These tasks were contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions, and the topics topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\nIn summary, at the time of writing this blog post (March 2024), the TL;DR of this [leaderboard](/llm-leaderboard) indicates:\n\n# Want to evaluate your AI apps?\n\nThis data is useful when choosing a model for a general task, but if you’d like to evaluate with your own benchmark data, then we can help!\n\n[Vellum](/old-home-2) has the tooling to support the entire lifecycle management of prompts from prototyping to production.

It has the highest \xa0results across multiple benchmarks. It achieved **91.60%** in Multilingual (MGSM), **90.20%** in Tool Use (BFCL), and an impressive **92.00%** in Code (HumanEval). It also performed well in Math (71.10%) and Reasoning (59.40%), making it a strong all-around performer across key categories.\n\nFor some of these benchmarks, we have other models who are relatively close to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Especially we're seeing big results from open sourced models, specifically Llama 3.1 405b. From this table we can summarize that:\n\n**A note on open-source models**\n\nMeta’s open-source models, particularly Llama 3.1 405b, performed impressively across benchmarks, competing closely with top proprietary models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It tied for first in Multilingual tasks and led in the General benchmark (MMLU) with 88.60%. Meta’s models offer a competitive alternative, especially in tasks like Code and Math, where Llama 3.1 405b consistently placed as a runner-up, proving that open-source models can deliver strong performance while offering more flexibility. Although not accessible for wider use, we definitely see a pattern where open-source models are starting to get similar results to top-tier proprietary models.\n\nIn the next sections we'll look at each of these benchmarks and some others, their datasets, and how they work.\n\n# Benchmarking LLMs for Reasoning\n\n**HellaSwag - Measuring Commonsense Inference**\n\n[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07830) | [dataset](https://github.com/rowanz/hellaswag/tree/master/data) [released 2019]\n\nThis test measures the c**ommonsense reasoning** of LLM models.

Testing on 14 open-source models and GPT-4V(ision) showed even GPT-4V achieved only 56% accuracy, highlighting significant room for improvement in multimodal AI models.\n\n![Overview of the MMMU Benchmark](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63f416b32254e8679cd8af88/66e199b7f208bf21b5e2ff41_66e195696c18d240f05f48b7_CleanShot%25202024-09-11%2520at%252015.04.27%25402x.png)\n\n# Multilingual Benchmarks\n\n**MGSM - Multilingual Benchmark**\n\n[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03057v1) | [dataset](https://github.com/google-research/url-nlp)\n\nThe Multilingual Grade School Math Benchmark (MGSM) is a collection of 250 grade-school math problems from the GSM8K dataset, translated into 10 languages by human annotators. GSM8K consists of 8.5K high-quality, linguistically diverse math word problems designed to evaluate models' ability to answer basic mathematical questions that involve multi-step reasoning.\n\n# Limitations of LLM Benchmarks\n\nThere are two major limitations of current LLM benchmarks:\n\n**1. Restricted scope**\n\nMany benchmarks have restricted scope, usually targeting capabilities on which LLMs have already proven some proficiency. Because they focus on areas where language models are known to be good, they're not great at finding new or unexpected skills that may emerge as language models get more advanced.\n\n**2. Short life span**\n\nAlso, benchmarks for language modeling often don't last long in terms of usefulness. Once language models reach a level of performance that's as good as humans on these benchmarks, the benchmarks are typically either stopped and swapped out or updated by adding harder challenges.\n\nThis short lifespan is likely because these benchmarks don't cover tasks that are much harder than what current language models can do.\n\nIt’s clear that as models continue to improve, they will achieve increasingly similar and higher scores on current benchmarks. So, we'll need to test models on future capabilities that are not possible now - with benchmarks like BBHard.\n\n\u200d\n\n# Testing Future Potential\n\n**BigBench - Predicting future potential**\n\n[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04615.pdf) | [dataset](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench?tab=readme-ov-file) [released 2023]\n\nBIG-bench is created to test the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models, and to understand how those capabilities and limitations are likely to change as models are improved.\n\nThis evaluation currently consists of 204 tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. These tasks were contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions, and the topics topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\nIn summary, at the time of writing this blog post (March 2024), the TL;DR of this [leaderboard](/llm-leaderboard) indicates:\n\n# Want to evaluate your AI apps?\n\nThis data is useful when choosing a model for a general task, but if you’d like to evaluate with your own benchmark data, then we can help!\n\n[Vellum](/old-home-2) has the tooling to support the entire lifecycle management of prompts from prototyping to production.

Language Models (LLMs) with emerging capabilities has spurred public curiosity to evaluate and compare different LLMs, leading many researchers to propose their own LLM benchmarks. Noticing preliminary inadequacies in those benchmarks, we embarked on a study to critically assess 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, using our novel unified evaluation framework through the lenses of people, process, and technology, under the pillars of benchmark functionality and integrity. Our research uncovered significant limitations, including biases, difficulties in measuring genuine reasoning, adaptability, implementation inconsistencies, prompt engineering complexity, evaluator diversity, and the overlooking of cultural and ideological norms in one comprehensive assessment. Our discussions emphasized the urgent need for standardized methodologies, regulatory certainties, and ethical guidelines in light of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, including advocating for an evolution from static benchmarks to dynamic behavioral profiling to accurately capture LLMs’ complex behaviors and potential risks. Our study highlighted the necessity for a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation methodologies, underlining the importance of collaborative efforts for the development of universally accepted benchmarks and the enhancement of AI systems’ integration into society.\n\n###### Index Terms:\n\n## I Introduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), a sophisticated branch of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), have evolved from narrow, task-specific systems to versatile models capable of few-shot learning and handling diverse tasks [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)]. Evaluating LLMs is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations. Automatic evaluation methods, which employ standard metrics, offer computational efficiency, while human evaluations provide nuanced insights into the quality and accuracy of LLM responses [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib4)]. Recent advancements like GPT-4 and Gemini, with their multimodal capabilities, and Mistral 8x7B’s integration of Mixture of Experts (MoE), have enhanced LLMs’ ability to process specialized domain knowledge and reason across diverse tasks [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)]. The proliferation of over 700,000 LLMs on platforms like HuggingFace, alongside many publicly available commercial LLMs, has intensified competition among developers, driving the need for benchmarks to uniformly evaluate and compare LLM performance across dimensions such as accuracy, robustness, and reasoning, as these directly influence an LLM’s reliability in real-world applications [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. For example, an LLM that excels in accuracy but lacks robustness might fail when confronted with unexpected inputs or novel scenarios. Benchmarks serve as standardized sets of tasks or datasets that assess key aspects such as accuracy, efficiency, and ethical considerations like bias or fairness, guiding both development and deployment decisions [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. Widely used benchmarks, such as GLUE, SuperGLUE, and MMLU, are expected to enable consistent LLM evaluations, allowing researchers to fine-tune LLMs for specific tasks or domains, and facilitating performance comparisons across different models in real-world scenarios.\n\nUnlike the automobile and aviation industries, where clear regulations and well-defined public consensus guide benchmarking practices [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib5)], the advanced AI field lacks such universally accepted standards, leading many researchers to devise their own benchmarks. Benchmarks of LLMs, such as BIG-bench [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6)] by Google DeepMind and PromptBench [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] by Microsoft Research, have encompassed diverse methods, each with unique approaches and criteria, focusing mainly on exam-style or task-based assessments. Such methods, evaluating models’ abilities to perform specific functions or solve problems, typically emphasized tasks with predefined answers or scenarios with limited variability [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)]. Models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, perplexity, and F1-score on fixed datasets (e.g., [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10)]), or using human evaluators to measure “human-level” performance (e.g., [[11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12)]). The common approach of LLM benchmarking has often assumed a standardized “correct” answer or a marking rubric for each question, which LLMs are expected to reproduce, and the same benchmark sets are repeatedly used to compare and rank LLMs, ignoring their broader implications and real-world applicability. While providing insights, we believe this approach often fails to capture the subtleties and complexities of real-world use, as previous studies mainly focused on functionality within the technological context, neglecting processual and human aspects, especially the diversity of human values and cultures [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13)]. For instance, an LLM that performs well on standardized tasks may still struggle in contexts requiring cultural sensitivity, such as understanding sophisticated social interactions or ethical concerns in decision-making, which can vary significantly across different societies and user groups. Additionally, LLM benchmarks have often lacked a thorough examination, especially in evaluating LLMs’ full capabilities, limitations, and safety issues [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)], highlighting the need for a more comprehensive and sophisticated approach. Evaluating LLMs and generative AI requires a method that assesses not only standardized task performance but also real-world applicability and safety, as a lack of such holistic evaluations can lead to LLMs that perform well in controlled environments but fail in critical real-world applications, posing risks such as perpetuating bias, making unsafe decisions, or being vulnerable to manipulation [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)].\n\nThis study was motivated by our concern over the rapid proliferation of LLM benchmark studies and the competition among them to establish superiority, often at the expense of well-rounded functionality and integrity assurance. When evaluating LLM benchmarks, two core aspects are critical for a reliable and unbiased evaluation of LLMs: functionality, which refers to how well a benchmark measures the specific capabilities of an LLM in alignment with real-world applications, and integrity, which ensures that the benchmark resists manipulation or gaming by models that exploit its criteria to produce misleading results. An inadequacy, in this context, refers to any deficiency or shortcoming in a benchmark’s ability to fully capture an LLM’s functionality or maintain its integrity during evaluation. Our preliminary observations indicated systemic inadequacies in most current LLM benchmarks, where superficial metrics often replaced comprehensive evaluations of LLM functionality and the assurance of benchmark integrity. As a result, many benchmarks failed to measure the complex, evolving capabilities of LLMs in real-world settings or address the risks of LLMs gaming and overfitting them. We propose a re-evaluation of current LLM benchmarking criteria, hypothesizing that a comprehensive evaluation framework must integrate both functionality and integrity, to provide a balanced, holistic, in-depth assessment of LLMs. This study aims to systematically analyze the inadequacies of current exam-style benchmarking in multimodal LLMs through the following research questions: (1) How can we identify, categorize, and explain the common inadequacies of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks? (2) Are these inadequacies evident in the popular benchmarks we have identified? (3) What should a comprehensive evaluation of LLM benchmarks include, considering both functionality and integrity for a complete understanding of LLM risks and societal impacts? Through this survey study, we propose a unified evaluation framework for LLM benchmarks, aligned with the domains of people, process, and technology, designed to facilitate a thorough examination of benchmarks. Our framework aims to enhance both functionality and integrity in benchmark design, guiding the development of more effective and secure LLM evaluation methods that reflect real-world applicability and ensure robust model development and deployment.\n\nThe major contributions of this study are as follows:\n\nWe proposed a unified evaluation framework for LLM benchmarks, based on the domains of people, process, and technology, as a foundation to comprehensively and holistically assess both the functionality and integrity of LLMs in real-world applications.\n\nUsing this framework, we conducted a systematic critique of 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, revealing key inadequacies and offering targeted methodological improvements to enhance the accuracy and fairness of LLM assessments.\n\nBuilding on the insights from our framework, we introduced an advanced evaluation method that extended traditional benchmarking with behavioral profiling and regular audits, creating a dynamic and ongoing assessment process that addressed evolving issues of real-world applicability, inclusivity, and security.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section [II](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S2 "II Background and Related Work ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence") offers a comprehensive analysis of prevalent benchmarks.

This section reviews traditional benchmarking practices in computer science and contrasts them with the emerging challenges of benchmarking in generative AI and LLMs.\n\n### II-A Traditional Benchmarking in Computer Science\n\nIn computer science, benchmarking involves running a set of standardized tests on hardware or software systems to measure their performance under controlled conditions [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib15)]. Such benchmarks are designed to be repeatable and objective, allowing for fair comparisons between different systems or configurations. For instance, the SPEC CPU benchmark suite evaluates a processor’s ability to handle compute-intensive tasks by measuring execution times of standardized workloads [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib16)]. Standardization is essential in benchmarking to ensure consistency across evaluations, making the results reliable and widely accepted within the community [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib17)]. Benchmarking methodologies typically focus on specific performance metrics such as processing speed, memory bandwidth, or energy efficiency [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib18), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib15)]. Tools like Cinebench and 3DMark assess computational performance by performing intensive CPU or GPU tasks, which is critical for high-performance computing applications, and they help identify system bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts, contributing to advancements in hardware and software design [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib17), [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib18), [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib15)]. The development of benchmarks requires careful consideration of workload representativeness to ensure that the tests reflect real-world usage scenarios [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib19)].\n\nHowever, traditional benchmarking faces challenges like benchmark manipulation, where systems are engineered to perform exceptionally well on specific benchmarks without delivering proportional real-world performance [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib20)]. For example, hardware manufacturers might optimize compilers or system settings to inflate benchmark scores, leading to misleading conclusions [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib21)]. This has prompted calls for more robust and comprehensive benchmarking practices that can resist gaming and provide a true measure of system capabilities [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib22)]. Additionally, the reliability of benchmarking results in computer science and AI depends critically on their reproducibility, generalizability across different contexts, consistency over time, and objectivity in measurement, but at the same time, it raises the question of who holds the authority to set benchmark standards [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib22), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib17)]. Consider that the same anti-malware products can score differently in tests like VB100, AV-Comparatives, and AV-Test, even when tests are administered around the same time, indicating variations in benchmarking criteria and evaluation methodologies [[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib23)]. Moreover, within the context of cybersecurity, our previous survey on ransomware revealed concerns about the self-benchmarking practices in many anti-ransomware studies, which often used diverse ransomware samples and methodologies and based their claims of superiority merely on higher detection rates [[24](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib24)]. This situation underscores the need for rigorous, comprehensive, and scientifically sound benchmarking practices that can provide reliable, meaningful and universally accepted comparisons.\n\n### II-B Benchmarking in Generative AI and LLMs\n\nBenchmarking in generative AI and LLMs introduces unique challenges that differ fundamentally from traditional computer science benchmarking. LLMs like Llama and GPT-4 are capable of understanding and generating human-like text, performing tasks ranging from translation to creative writing [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib4)]. Evaluating such models requires benchmarks that can assess not just quantitative performance, but also qualitative aspects like coherence, relevance, and ethical considerations [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. Unlike traditional benchmarks with clear numerical metrics, LLM benchmarking often involves subjective judgments and complex evaluation criteria [[25](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib25), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13)]. LLM benchmarks commonly involve tasks such as language understanding, reasoning, and dialogue generation, using datasets like GLUE to provide standardized evaluation platforms [[26](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib26)]. However, the open-ended nature of language means that there can be multiple valid responses to a given prompt, complicating the assessment of correctness [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1)]. Furthermore, LLMs operate as black boxes with opaque internal mechanisms, making it difficult to interpret their decision-making processes and identify potential biases or ethical issues [[27](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib27), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib4)]. This opacity poses risks when models generate harmful or biased content without transparent accountability mechanisms [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. For instance, an LLM used in a customer service chatbot might produce inappropriate or biased responses based on hidden internal biases, without any easy way to diagnose the underlying issue or improve the LLM’s behavior [[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib29)]. In high-stakes domains like healthcare or legal services, black-box LLMs could make critical errors without providing interpretable justifications, undermining trust and making it difficult to ensure the LLM’s safety or fairness [[30](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib30)]. The current LLM evaluation processes could vary significantly, involving text string comparisons for straightforward answers or relying on human judgment for more complex and subtle responses [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)].\n\nUnlike traditional benchmarks that are often static and hardware-focused, LLM benchmarking must account for the dynamic and evolving nature of language and societal norms [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31)]. LLMs can inadvertently learn and propagate biases present in training data, requiring benchmarks that can detect and mitigate such issues [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib32)]. Additionally, LLMs may overfit to benchmark datasets, memorizing answers rather than demonstrating true understanding, which undermines the validity of the evaluation [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib33)]. The potential for data contamination, where test data leaks into training datasets, further complicates the benchmarking process [[34](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib34)]. Moreover, the global deployment of LLMs requires benchmarks that consider linguistic diversity and cultural nuances, moving beyond English-centric evaluations to include multiple languages and dialects, which contrasts with traditional benchmarks that are largely language-agnostic or focused on English [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib35)]. Ethical considerations are also more pronounced in LLM benchmarking, as LLMs must navigate complex social norms and avoid generating inappropriate content [[36](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib36)]. The aforementioned factors require a multidisciplinary approach to LLM benchmarking, integrating insights from linguistics, ethics, and social sciences to create robust evaluation frameworks [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13), [30](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib30)].\n\n## III Unified Evaluation Framework for LLM Benchmarks\n\nIn this section, we developed a comprehensive framework to benchmark LLMs, grounded in principles of cybersecurity risk assessment. We based the framework on a thorough review of existing literature and best practices in the field, tailoring it to address the unique capabilities and challenges presented by generative AI especially LLMs. This framework was designed not only to assess technical performance but also to evaluate the broader applicability, robustness, and integrity of LLM benchmarks.\n\n### III-A Applying the People, Process, Technology (PPT) Framework\n\nThe People, Process, Technology (PPT) framework, widely used in cybersecurity, is also well-suited for evaluating LLM benchmarks due to its holistic approach, addressing not just technical factors, but also human and procedural elements [[37](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib37)]. While other frameworks (e.g., the Information Systems Success Model [[38](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib38)]) focus on narrower aspects, PPT is uniquely comprehensive, allowing for an in-depth assessment across multiple dimensions. This ensures a thorough evaluation of benchmarks, which require more than just technical soundness; they must also integrate human expertise and follow robust, adaptable processes. The PPT framework aligns with the core challenges of LLM benchmarking. Benchmarks involve complex interactions between developers, evaluators, and end-users (People), they must follow consistent and adaptable methodologies to remain relevant and resilient (Process), and they depend on scalable and reliable technical infrastructures (Technology) to accurately assess evolving LLM capabilities. The success of an LLM benchmark is not only in its ability to test specific tasks but also in how well it adapts to new challenges, handles real-world use cases, and resists manipulation or overfitting.\n\nPeople: The expertise and diversity of developers, evaluators, and end-users influence the validity and applicability of benchmark results. A lack of diversity in evaluators could bias results, making benchmarks less reflective of LLMs’ real-world performance across varied scenarios.\n\nProcess: Standardization and adaptability in benchmark construction and implementation are essential. Without well-defined processes, benchmarks may become outdated, inconsistent, or vulnerable to LLMs being optimized solely for specific test sets rather than demonstrating true capability.\n\nTechnology: The technical infrastructure supporting benchmarks, including algorithms, datasets, and evaluation metrics, must be scalable and robust. Technical limitations can impede the benchmark’s ability to provide accurate assessments, while ensuring the infrastructure’s scalability is critical as LLMs evolve and grow more complex.\n\nThe PPT framework thus provides a holistic lens to comprehensively evaluate LLM benchmarks, addressing both functionality and integrity. By integrating people, process, and technology, this framework allows for a more nuanced assessment compared to models that may overlook key aspects of LLM benchmarking. The PPT approach aligns with the need for multidisciplinary evaluation methods in complex AI systems, as highlighted in recent literature [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. Leveraging the PPT framework ensures our evaluation encompasses all necessary facets to produce reliable and meaningful insights into LLM performance and benchmarking practices.\n\n### III-B Functionality and Integrity in LLM Benchmarks\n\nWhen evaluating LLM benchmarks, two core aspects must be considered: functionality and integrity. Functionality assesses how well a benchmark measures the specific capabilities of LLMs, while integrity examines the benchmark’s resistance to manipulation or gaming by models that may exploit its criteria to achieve misleading results. Evaluating both functionality and integrity is essential to ensure that benchmarks provide a comprehensive and authentic assessment of LLMs, free from bias or manipulation.\n\nFunctionality Assessment: This determines if the benchmark accurately evaluates the intended capabilities of an LLM, such as reasoning, language comprehension, or multimodal integration. For instance, a benchmark should be designed to test the model’s true understanding rather than its ability to mimic expected answers. A counterexample is using benchmarks that rely on superficial elements like keyword matching, which can lead to overestimating an LLM’s language understanding when it simply exploits patterns without grasping the content. Functionality also considers the alignment of the benchmark with real-world applications, ensuring it tests skills relevant to practical use rather than artificial metrics.\n\nIntegrity Considerations: This involves assessing the robustness of the benchmark against potential exploitation by models tuned to optimize for specific evaluation metrics. For example, a benchmark lacking integrity might be susceptible to LLMs that achieve high scores through memorization of training data or by exploiting specific test set characteristics. An integrity breach occurs when LLMs appear to excel in benchmarks through these surface-level optimizations without demonstrating genuine capability. Ensuring integrity means the benchmark cannot be easily manipulated and that it provides a true reflection of an LLM’s performance, independent of prior exposure to similar tests or over-fitting strategies.\n\n### III-C Data Collection\n\nWe conducted a Structured Literature Review (SLR) to systematically identify relevant LLM benchmarks. Our focus was on benchmarks explicitly designed for evaluating large language models, particularly those with multimodal capabilities. The search encompassed peer-reviewed publications, prominent technical preprints, and widely cited benchmarking platforms up to October 2023.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nBenchmarks explicitly designed for LLM evaluation.\n\nBenchmarks covering a wide range of generative AI tasks, including language understanding, reasoning, coding, legal analysis, medical question answering, and tool usage.\n\nBenchmarks with substantial academic or technical adoption, indicated by citation counts or recognition in the AI community.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nBenchmarks that are too niche or focus on specialized tasks not representative of general LLM capabilities.\n\nBenchmarks lacking sufficient methodological detail for thorough evaluation.\n\n### III-D Data Analysis\n\nWe applied thematic analysis to systematically evaluate the selected benchmarks, focusing on identifying patterns of inadequacies in functionality and integrity. Our analysis aimed to determine whether the benchmarks accurately measured LLM capabilities without relying on superficial metrics or presentation nuances, and whether they could be manipulated by LLMs exploiting specific evaluation criteria. Our methodology involved the following steps:\n\nIdentification of Inadequacies: We critically reviewed each benchmark to identify potential inadequacies related to functionality and integrity, such as response variability, susceptibility to overfitting, and lack of consideration for linguistic diversity.\n\nCoding and Categorization: We coded the identified inadequacies and categorized them based on common themes, aligning with the domains of people, process, and technology as outlined in our unified evaluation framework.\n\nAssessment of Prevalence: We defined prevalence as the number of benchmarks (out of 23) exhibiting each specific inadequacy (except those resolved or not present). This metric quantifies the extent to which each inadequacy is present across the benchmarks.\n\nEvaluation of Benchmark Responses: For each identified inadequacy, we examined whether it was acknowledged or addressed by the benchmark creators. We categorized the benchmarks accordingly:\n\nPresent and Unacknowledged (marked as ✓): The inadequacy exists without recognition.\n\nAcknowledged but Unresolved (marked as △△\\triangle△): The inadequacy is recognized but not yet addressed.\n\nConsidered Addressed (marked as ×\\times×): The inadequacy has been recognized and mitigated.\n\nThe evaluation process is illustrated in Fig.\xa0[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S3.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ III-D Data Analysis ‣ III Unified Evaluation Framework for LLM Benchmarks ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"), which guided our systematic assessment of each benchmark’s robustness and reliability.\n\n## IV Overview of LLM Benchmarks\n\nIn this section, we list the overview 23 LLM benchmarks we surveyed, including what they have achieved, and our preliminary findings.\n\n### IV-A LLM Benchmarks and Their Characteristics\n\nApplying such criteria of our Unified Evaluation Framework, we selected 23 LLM benchmarks that represented a diverse set of tasks and domains, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the LLM evaluation landscape.

analysis, as summarised in Table [II](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S4.T2 "TABLE II ‣ IV-B Preliminary Findings Overview ‣ IV Overview of LLM Benchmarks ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"), revealed widespread inadequacies across LLM benchmark studies, indicating the need for more refined and comprehensive evaluation practices to better assess the true capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs). A key observation is that many benchmarks predominantly focus on English, with limited representation of other languages, such as Simplified Chinese, and frequently neglect cultural and contextual variations in their questions and answers. This raises concerns about the generalizability of these benchmarks across diverse linguistic and cultural settings. For instance, benchmarks often assume singular correct answers in culturally nuanced questions, overlooking alternative valid responses from different cultural or religious perspectives, which limits the inclusivity of these evaluations. Another critical issue is that current benchmarks generally adopt task-based formats, such as Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and dialogue-based evaluations, which tend to be static and do not capture the evolving nature of human-AI interactions. Real-world LLM usage often involves continuous dialogues, yet many benchmarks assess only the first attempt of an LLM response, without considering the consistency and coherence of answers across multiple interactions. This focus on isolated responses reduces the relevance of these benchmarks in evaluating models designed for dynamic, ongoing interactions.\n\nOur review also found that only 6 of the 23 surveyed benchmark studies ([[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)]) were peer-reviewed at the time of this article, reflecting the early-stage nature of research in this domain. While preprints provide valuable insights, the lack of rigorous peer review raises questions about the scientific validity and reproducibility of many LLM benchmark results. Moreover, the speed of LLM output generation—a crucial factor for user experience in real-time applications—is frequently overlooked in current benchmarks, which tend to focus solely on the qualitative correctness of generated answers. Perhaps most concerning, many benchmarks failed to account for the possibility that LLMs can optimize their responses specifically to perform well on standardized tests, rather than genuinely demonstrating deep understanding or reasoning. This risk of ”benchmark gaming” undermines the integrity of evaluations, as models may be engineered to exploit the structure of the test rather than showcasing their full capabilities across diverse tasks. Given the rapid advancement of LLMs, it is imperative to develop evaluation practices that measure genuine reasoning skills and adaptability, rather than technical optimization for specific test formats. Our critique is grounded in published opinions and supported by our evaluative rationale, detailed in Sections [V](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S5 "V Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"), [VI](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S6 "VI Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"), and [VII](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S7 "VII Human Dynamics ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence"). The aim of this analysis is not to elevate any specific benchmark but to highlight common limitations that many benchmarks share. By addressing these issues, we seek to encourage the development of more robust, transparent, and representative benchmarks that better reflect the full range of LLM capabilities. The following sections provide an in-depth exploration of these findings, categorized into technological aspects, processual elements, and human dynamics.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|

in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")).\n\n### V-A Response Variability in Standardized Evaluations\n\nPrevalence: 22/23\n\nA significant inadequacy in LLM benchmarks is the response variability under standardized evaluations, especially when these benchmarks fail to account for LLMs tailored to specific formats or use cases. Despite the breadth of frameworks like [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)], they often overlook the subtle behaviors of LLMs designed for particular scenarios (Appendix [A-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS1 "A-A Response Variability in Standardized Evaluations ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Benchmarks that standardize formats without considering context-specific requirements can inadvertently skew the perceived functionality of these LLMs. For example, minor formatting changes in prompts, such as altering choice indicators from (A) to [A] or adding extra spaces, have been shown to shift response accuracy by approximately 5%, highlighting the LLMs’ sensitivity to superficial input variations [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)]. From a functionality perspective, this variability raises concerns about the accuracy of these benchmarks in measuring true model capabilities. If benchmarks fail to reflect the intended application context, they may mislead users and developers regarding the model’s practical performance, influencing deployment strategies inappropriately [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. Integrity concerns also arise when standardized benchmarks become predictable and exploitable, allowing LLMs to achieve artificially high scores through superficial optimization rather than genuine comprehension. This vulnerability to input sensitivity indicates a lack of robustness in the benchmarks, which could be exploited in practical applications, posing risks to system reliability and security [[54](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib54)]. To address such issues, LLM benchmark designs must be refined to accommodate the specificities of model architecture and intended use cases, ensuring they accurately capture the capabilities of LLMs in varied contexts. This approach will enhance the functionality and integrity of the evaluations, reducing the potential for misrepresentation and gaming of results, and ultimately leading to a more authentic assessment of LLM capabilities.\n\n### V-B Genuine Reasoning vs Technical Optimization\n\nPrevalence: 22/23\n\nThe challenge in distinguishing between responses driven by genuine reasoning and those resulting from technical optimization, such as overfitting to benchmark answers, was seen in [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [A-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS2 "A-B Genuine Reasoning vs Technical Optimization ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")), due to the opaque nature of LLMs, where the mechanisms behind their outputs are often not transparent. Consequently, LLMs can appear to demonstrate advanced reasoning when, in reality, they may simply be leveraging specific benchmark characteristics or exploiting superficial patterns. For example, an LLM trained on data that includes benchmark-like questions may produce correct answers by recognizing patterns rather than understanding the underlying concepts [[55](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib55), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)]. For example, HumanEval [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8)] evaluated Codex’s performance through functional correctness on programming problems, which might not fully capture the model’s reasoning capabilities across diverse real-world scenarios. Similarly, LegalBench [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)] applied generic benchmarks to specialized legal reasoning tasks, potentially allowing LLMs to optimize for benchmark-specific patterns rather than demonstrating true legal comprehension that could include court negotiations.\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, this ambiguity undermines the benchmarks’ ability to accurately assess LLMs’ reasoning capabilities. If a benchmark fails to differentiate between true reasoning and optimization, it risks overestimating the model’s practical utility and cognitive abilities. A critical insight here is that benchmarks should be designed to probe deeper understanding rather than surface-level pattern recognition, ensuring that LLMs cannot succeed merely by exploiting familiar test elements. Regarding integrity, the inability to distinguish genuine reasoning from optimization raises concerns about the potential for LLMs to manipulate benchmark outcomes. LLMs that can achieve high scores through memorization or strategic over-fitting challenge the validity of the evaluation process. This issue is particularly problematic when benchmarks are inadvertently included in training data, allowing LLMs to produce artificially inflated results without demonstrating true competence [[55](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib55), [56](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib56)]. Addressing this requires designing benchmarks that are resistant to such exploitation, ensuring they accurately reflect the LLM’s ability to engage in authentic reasoning processes rather than optimized mimicry. To mitigate such challenges, benchmark designs must evolve to include tasks that require dynamic reasoning and adaptability, reducing the risk of LLMs gaming the system through technical optimizations. Continuous refinement and innovation in benchmark methodologies are essential to differentiate genuine reasoning from mere pattern exploitation, thereby providing a more reliable assessment of LLM capabilities.\n\n### V-C Tension Between Helpfulness and Harmlessness\n\nPrevalence: 19/23\n\nThe tension between helpfulness and harmlessness in LLM responses presents a significant challenge in benchmark evaluations, seen in [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [A-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS3 "A-C Tension Between Helpfulness and Harmlessness ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Human evaluations, such as A/B tests, often struggle to balance those two aspects, particularly in open-ended dialogues. For instance, MultiMedQA [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10)] assessed Flan-PaLM’s performance in medical question answering, revealing that while the model could provide accurate information, it occasionally failed to align with clinical consensus, indicating a struggle to balance helpfulness with the necessity of harmlessness in sensitive medical contexts. Similarly, LegalBench [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)] evaluated LLMs on legal reasoning tasks, where the models needed to deliver precise legal information without overstepping into providing authoritative legal advice, thereby maintaining a balance between being helpful and avoiding potential legal ramifications. Such difficulty arises from the need to provide information without causing harm or controversy, a balance that is particularly delicate when addressing sensitive topics.\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, LLM benchmarks must accurately measure an LLM’s ability to provide informative yet harmless responses. This requires sophisticated evaluation criteria that distinguish between helpfulness in providing useful information and harmlessness in avoiding misinformation or offensive content. Benchmarks that fail to account for this balance risk either over-penalizing LLMs for providing valuable but sensitive information or underestimating the potential for harm in their responses [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3)]. An insightful example is the evaluation of LLMs in the context of cybersecurity advice, where helpfulness could involve explaining malware analysis techniques, but doing so without risking the dissemination of potentially harmful information. Regarding integrity, benchmarks must be robust against LLMs that could exploit this tension to appear more capable [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. For instance, LLMs might evade challenging inquiries by refusing to respond, prioritizing harmlessness over helpfulness to avoid any potential controversy. This behavior could lead to a misleading assessment of the model’s abilities, giving the impression of ethical consideration when it may simply be avoiding complexity. To ensure integrity, benchmarks should test for situations where LLMs can demonstrate both helpfulness and harmlessness without compromising one for the other. Addressing this inadequacy requires developing benchmarks that incorporate high-level norms and values, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of how LLMs navigate this tension.\n\n### V-D Linguistic Variability and Embedded Logic Diversity\n\nPrevalence: 17/23\n\nCurrent LLM benchmarks often fail to account for the linguistic and logical diversity inherent in different languages, leading to an inadequate evaluation of LLMs’ true capabilities, as seen in [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12)] (Appendix [A-D](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS4 "A-D Linguistic Variability and Embedded Logic Diversity ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Predominantly English-centric benchmarks overlook the sophisticated reasoning patterns embedded within languages, when language structure can shape distinct cognitive processes [[57](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib57), [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. This lack of consideration results in benchmarks that wrongfully assume a uniform cognitive framework, failing to capture how LLMs handle linguistic variations across different cultures and languages [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13)].\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, this inadequacy undermines the benchmarks’ ability to evaluate LLMs in a multilingual context accurately. By not reflecting the cognitive diversity inherent in language structures, these benchmarks may misrepresent a model’s comprehension and reasoning capabilities. For instance, an LLM evaluated solely on English-centric benchmarks might appear proficient but could struggle to maintain accuracy and context in languages with different syntactic and semantic frameworks. This bias risks overestimating a model’s universality and applicability across languages. In terms of integrity, the oversight in linguistic variability can be exploited, as uneven moderation across languages may allow harmful or prohibited content to bypass detection in less moderated languages [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib35)]. A model might score well on benchmarks in its primary language but fail to uphold the same standards in others, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. Besides, a blend of different languages could sometimes be used to jailbreak LLMs without triggering LLM safety mechanisms like RLHF [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. Addressing such challenges requires benchmarks that recognize and adapt to linguistic diversity, testing LLMs on native language capabilities rather than relying on translation-based evaluations.\n\n### V-E Benchmark Installation and Scalability\n\nPrevalence: 16/23\n\nA key inadequacy in current LLM benchmarks is the challenge of installation and scalability, affecting their functional utility and integrity [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [A-E](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS5 "A-E Benchmark Installation and Scalability ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Many benchmarks demand considerable engineering effort to install and adapt to different computational environments, hindering broad accessibility and consistent evaluation across diverse LLMs. For example, SciBench [[46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46)] involved manual data extraction and complex problem formulations, further complicating the installation process. Moreover, scaling such benchmarks to handle larger LLMs or more extensive datasets often requires substantial infrastructure and resources, as reported by Anthropic [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)], posing a barrier to comprehensive and efficient assessments. For instance, APIBank [[50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50)] involved the complex implementation of 73 APIs, demanding extensive engineering efforts and resources to scale effectively.\n\nFrom a functionality standpoint, these technical hurdles delay and complicate the evaluation process, potentially limiting the ability to accurately measure LLM performance. For instance, if a benchmark cannot be efficiently scaled, it may fail to test an LLM’s capabilities under more demanding or realistic scenarios, resulting in an incomplete functional assessment. This limitation can lead to biased evaluations that do not fully represent an LLM’s operational capacities, especially for larger LLMs requiring more intensive testing environments. In terms of integrity, the difficulty in installing and scaling benchmarks can create inconsistencies in how LLMs are evaluated, opening the door to manipulation. If a benchmark is too complex to implement consistently, results may vary between environments, allowing LLMs to be selectively tested in conditions favorable to them. This lack of standardization can compromise the benchmark’s resistance to gaming by LLMs, undermining the reliability of its evaluation metrics. Improving the installation and scalability of benchmarks is crucial for ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and resistant to exploitation. Streamlined, well-documented benchmarks that can be easily deployed across different systems will enhance both the functional assessment of LLMs and the integrity of the evaluation process, enabling fairer and more accurate comparisons of model performance.\n\n### V-F Biases in LLM-Generated LLM Evaluations\n\nPrevalence: 9/23\n\nAn emerging concern in LLM benchmarks is the use of LLMs themselves to generate evaluation tasks or assess other LLMs, effectively acting as both creator and judge [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45)] (Appendix [A-F](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A1.SS6 "A-F Biases in LLM-Generated LLM Evaluations ‣ Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). This practice introduces the risk of amplifying inherent biases and inaccuracies present in the evaluating LLMs, which can significantly undermine the benchmark’s functionality and integrity. For instance, M3KE [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9)] utilized ChatGPT-generated multiple-choice questions to assess Chinese LLMs, inherently incorporating the biases of ChatGPT.\n\nFrom a functionality standpoint, such biases can distort the evaluation process, leading to inaccurate assessments of LLM capabilities. For instance, an LLM-generated benchmark might inadvertently favor certain types of responses or reasoning patterns, resulting in an overestimation or underestimation of the evaluated model’s performance [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1)]. This issue raises concerns about the benchmark’s ability to provide a true measure of an LLM’s diverse capabilities, potentially skewing its alignment with real-world applications. Regarding integrity, relying on LLMs for evaluation introduces the risk of circular reasoning, where the biases inherent in the LLMs generating the benchmarks could lead to evaluations that are not truly independent. This undermines the benchmark’s resistance to manipulation, as LLMs could exploit these biases to achieve misleadingly high scores. For example, if an LLM-generated benchmark unintentionally reinforces specific patterns or knowledge it was trained on, it may allow LLMs to perform well through pattern recognition rather than demonstrating genuine understanding or reasoning [[58](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib58), [56](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib56)]. To ensure both functionality and integrity, a more balanced approach that integrates human expertise is necessary. Human involvement can mitigate the biases introduced by LLM-generated content, ensuring a more rigorous and objective evaluation process. This hybrid approach would enhance the benchmark’s ability to provide a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of LLM capabilities, ensuring that evaluations remain reliable and reflective of true model performance.\n\n## VI Processual Elements\n\nThis section looks into the various process-related challenges and intricacies inherent in the implementation and evaluation of LLM benchmarks (Fig. [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S6.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ VI Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Please note that we use the word “Processual” to refer to the overall nature and development of processes, instead of “procedural” which focuses on specific steps or methods.\n\n### VI-A Inconsistent Benchmark Implementation\n\nPrevalence: 18/23\n\nA critical issue identified in LLM benchmarks is the inconsistency in implementation across different research teams, as observed in [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [B-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A2.SS1 "B-A Inconsistent Benchmark Implementation ‣ Appendix B Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Variations in the interpretation and execution of benchmarks, including differences in few-shot learning setups or chain-of-thought prompting, have led to diverse results that challenge the uniformity and reliability of these evaluations. For example, benchmarks like MMLU showed significant score variations due to differing implementation strategies [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)]. Similarly, M3KE [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9)] required substantial customization to accommodate language-specific subtleties, leading to inconsistencies in assessing Chinese LLMs across different research environments.\n\nFunctionally, this inconsistency hampers the benchmarks’ ability to provide a uniform, objective assessment of LLMs. The lack of standardization in implementation can result in skewed outcomes, making it difficult to compare LLMs fairly or derive meaningful insights into their performance [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)]. This undermines the benchmarks’ functionality, as the results become less reliable for comparative analysis or performance tracking across different LLMs. From an integrity perspective, such inconsistencies can introduce vulnerabilities in the evaluation process. The absence of standardized implementation protocols opens up opportunities for manipulation or biased interpretations, where variations in methodology could be exploited to produce favorable outcomes without reflecting the model’s genuine capabilities [[55](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib55), [56](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib56)]. This compromises the benchmark’s integrity, as differing approaches might obscure true performance or create loopholes that can be exploited. To address such concerns, establishing standardized protocols and guidelines for benchmark implementation is essential. A uniform approach would enhance the consistency and reliability of LLM evaluations, ensuring that benchmarks provide a fair and accurate reflection of model capabilities.\n\n### VI-B Slow Test Iteration Time\n\nPrevalence: 18/23\n\nSlow iteration time is a key inadequacy in LLM benchmarks, particularly in comprehensive third-party frameworks like BIG-bench and HELM [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [B-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A2.SS2 "B-B Slow Test Iteration Time ‣ Appendix B Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). These frameworks often involve extensive evaluation processes, which can span weeks or months, hindering timely feedback on new LLMs. External involvement in evaluations adds further delays, requiring coordination and engineering support, as seen in benchmarks like BIG-bench [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6)] and HELM [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31)]. The need for comprehensive testing across diverse scenarios inherently extends evaluation time.\n\nFunctionally, prolonged iteration times hinder the benchmarks’ ability to provide current insights into LLM performance. For instance, SciBench [[46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46)] involved manual data extraction and complex problem formulations, which significantly extended the evaluation process, making it difficult to keep pace with the rapid advancements in LLM development. With AI advancing rapidly, an LLM may undergo significant updates during its evaluation period, potentially rendering the results outdated or irrelevant by the time they are published [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)]. From an integrity perspective, slow iteration times pose security risks. Delayed evaluations mean emerging threats or vulnerabilities in LLMs may go undetected for extended periods, exposing systems to potential exploitation [[59](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib59), [54](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib54)]. For example, ToolBench [[48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48)] integrated LLMs with a vast number of software APIs, requiring extensive manual configuration and adaptation, which could delay the identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the lag in benchmark feedback to LLMs would limit the ability to promptly address identified issues, allowing weaknesses to persist longer than necessary. To mitigate such challenges, streamlining evaluation processes and improving coordination with external parties is crucial. However, aligning the need for thorough evaluation with the rapid development pace of AI remains a complex issue, requiring innovative solutions to balance depth and timeliness in LLM benchmarking.\n\n### VI-C Challenge of Proper Prompt Engineering in Benchmarking\n\nPrevalence: 14/23\nPrompt engineering plays a crucial role in evaluating LLMs, as it shapes the interaction between the model and the test. While exploring different prompts is valuable for understanding LLM behavior, in the context of benchmarking, it is important to ensure that prompts are designed to accurately and consistently assess the LLM’s capabilities. Challenges can arise when variations in prompt formulation lead to significant differences in model performance, which can complicate the interpretation of benchmark results [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib51), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45)] (Appendix [B-C](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A2.SS3 "B-C Challenge of Proper Prompt Engineering ‣ Appendix B Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Processual Elements ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). For example, MMLU [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39)] employed a variety of prompts across different subjects to assess knowledge, but inconsistencies in prompt phrasing could lead to overestimation of the LLM’s capabilities in certain areas.\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, inconsistency in prompt design can lead to assessments that do not accurately reflect the model’s true capabilities. For example, prompts that are overly leading or ambiguous may result in responses that either overestimate or underestimate the LLM’s performance, and this variability can make it difficult to compare results across different models or studies [[60](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib60)]. Regarding integrity, if benchmarks do not standardize prompt construction, there is a risk that LLMs could be fine-tuned or engineered to perform well on specific prompt styles, potentially compromising the fairness of the evaluation [[35](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib35), [54](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib54)]. To address such challenges, it is essential for benchmarks to adopt careful prompt engineering practices that aim for clarity, neutrality, and consistency, thereby ensuring that the evaluation accurately captures the model’s capabilities without introducing unintended biases.\n\n## VII Human Dynamics\n\nThis section explores the subtle complexities of human factors influencing LLM benchmarks (Fig. [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#S7.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ VII Human Dynamics ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")).\n\n### VII-A Diversity in Human Curators and Evaluators\n\nPrevalence: 19/23\n\nThe heterogeneity among human curators and evaluators significantly impacts the construction and assessment of LLM benchmarks. Even with standardized guidelines, differences in cultural, religious, political, and academic or commercial backgrounds can introduce inconsistencies, particularly in subjective evaluations where linguistic and interpretative diversity play a role. This challenge was evident in benchmarks involving human judgment, such as those relying on sophisticated response evaluation or red-teaming (for cybersecurity purposes) [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib8), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib48), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [47](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib47), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [45](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib45), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [C-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A3.SS1 "C-A Diversity in Human Curators and Evaluators ‣ Appendix C Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Human Dynamics ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")).\n\nFrom a functionality perspective, this diversity can lead to subjective biases in benchmark construction and evaluation. For instance, cultural nuances can result in varying interpretations of responses, affecting the consistency and objectivity of the assessment [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53), [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib1)]. For instance, LegalBench [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)] utilized legal professionals from diverse jurisdictions to evaluate LLMs’ legal reasoning, yet the varying interpretations of legal principles across different regions could skew the results and lead to inconsistent assessments, making it difficult to ensure a uniform evaluation standard across different LLMs. Regarding integrity, inconsistent application and interpretation by diverse evaluators can open avenues for manipulation or biased outcomes. Disparities in evaluation criteria might allow LLMs to exploit certain nuances to achieve favorable results, undermining the benchmark’s robustness and trustworthiness [[59](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib59)]. This inconsistency can make it challenging to safeguard against potential biases or exploitation within the evaluation process. Addressing such issue requires a careful balance between leveraging diverse perspectives and ensuring consistency in evaluation. While diversity among evaluators enriches the assessment process, standardized protocols and training are necessary to minimize subjective biases and enhance the reliability of LLM benchmarks.\n\n### VII-B Diverse Cultural, Social, Political, Religious, and Ideological Norms\n\nPrevalence: 18/23\n\nLLM benchmarks face the inherent challenge of encompassing a wide range of cultural, religious, political, and ideological norms [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib40), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib42), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14), [39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43), [50](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib50), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib52), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib31), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib49), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib9), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41), [44](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib44), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib46), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib11), [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib12), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib7)] (Appendix [C-B](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#A3.SS2 "C-B Diverse Cultural, Social, Political, Religious and Ideological Norms ‣ Appendix C Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Human Dynamics ‣ Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence")). Given that humans often disagree on fundamental issues, including interpretations of universal principles like human rights, pursuing a universal benchmark that addresses all cultural and ideological perspectives may be unrealistic. Benchmarks that rely on standardized answers or rubrics can inadvertently clash with diverse values, highlighting the impossibility of creating a one-size-fits-all evaluation. For example, LegalBench [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib14)], with its focus on American legal reasoning, may overestimate its applicability across diverse global legal contexts. Conversely, the integrity of Simplified Chinese LLM benchmarks like C-Eval [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib43)] can be easily gamed by specific prompt structures or leverage training data tailored to the Simplified Chinese context, such as offering responses that align with or praise Chinese ideologies, to achieve artificially high scores without demonstrating genuine understanding or reasoning [[61](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib61)].\n\nFunctionally, this diversity means that benchmarks may struggle to fairly and accurately evaluate LLMs across varying viewpoints. An LLM’s response to sensitive topics might be deemed appropriate in one cultural context but controversial in another [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13), [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. This inconsistency challenges the creation of benchmarks that can impartially assess LLMs’ ability to navigate complex societal norms. An example of compromising benchmark integrity could be when benchmarks are tailored to avoid controversy (saying what people want to hear), leading to superficial assessments that do not truly evaluate the LLM’s ability to handle subtle or sensitive topics, thereby allowing LLMs to appear more competent than they actually are in real-world scenarios [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)]. However, LLM providers and benchmark assessors are faced with the difficult decision of potentially offending some individuals, regardless of whether they aim for inclusivity or specificity. This is not a failure on their part, but rather an acknowledgment of the inherently subjective nature of humanity norms. Given such complexities, it may be more pragmatic for researchers to focus on context-specific benchmarks rather than striving for a universal standard benchmark for all human norms.\n\n## VIII Discussions\n\nThis section provides a comprehensive discussion of the underlying causes that have resulted in the previously aforementioned inadequacies in current LLM benchmarking methods.\n\n### VIII-A Misuse of the Term “Benchmark”\n\nThe term “benchmark”, which should mean to the process of evaluating and comparing the performance of LLMs using standardized tests and metrics, has been applied more liberally in academic publishing than warranted, reflecting the evolving stage of AI regulatory compliance and public consensus on generative AI’s emerging role and impact. Consequently, a wide array of non-standardized LLM test sets have been self-declared as LLM benchmarks, often lacking the rigor and uniformity required for true benchmarking. Genuine benchmarks should provide standardized, comprehensive evaluations, distinguishing them from more informal assessments rooted in researchers’ subjective perspectives. Many so-called benchmarks serve merely as initial test sets tailored to specific LLM tasks, often falling short in integrity and functionality. Unlike fields such as automotive or aviation, where benchmarks are guided by established regulations and public consensus, the AI domain remains largely unregulated and in flux. This has led researchers to create varied task sets and questions, adding complexity to LLM evaluation and potentially misguiding interpretations of these sets as complete assessments of LLM capabilities. While such efforts contribute to the evolving landscape of LLM evaluation, highlighting the need for evolving standards, they also demonstrate the urgency for structured, universally accepted benchmarking frameworks. We believe that effective LLM benchmarks should rigorously assess functionality while being resilient to manipulation, ensuring they accurately reflect true model capabilities rather than superficial optimizations. The current research landscape requires benchmarks that align with emerging regulatory mandates and societal needs, particularly as LLMs become increasingly integrated into various aspects of life. Through rigorously designed benchmarks, we can ensure the accurate assessment of LLMs’ growing capabilities, guiding their responsible development and deployment.\n\n### VIII-B Assessment Limitations for Reasoning and Multimodality\n\nCurrent LLM benchmarks exhibit significant limitations in both functionality and integrity when assessing comprehensive reasoning and multimodal capabilities. Functionally, many benchmarks fail to evaluate the depth of LLMs’ reasoning and multimodal integration because they primarily focus on text-based tasks, neglecting the intricate processing required for integrating visual, auditory, and other sensory data [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib3), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib2)]. This narrow focus often results in benchmarks that assess only surface-level performance, without engaging the models in scenarios that require true multimodal understanding or complex reasoning. For example, benchmarks that rely on simple question-answer formats may inadvertently assess a model’s ability to recall learned patterns rather than its capacity for creative problem-solving, thereby conflating crystal (recalled knowledge) and fluid (creative problem-solving) intelligence. In terms of integrity, such benchmarks are vulnerable to being manipulated by LLMs that have been overfitted to specific datasets or tuned to exploit particular evaluation metrics, when benchmarks allow models to achieve high scores through memorization or pattern exploitation rather than demonstrating genuine capability. For instance, a model trained on benchmark-specific data can deliver seemingly impressive results without possessing the underlying understanding or adaptability required in real-world applications. Consequently, current benchmarks may provide misleading assessments of LLM capabilities, due to superficial optimization strategies [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib28)].\n\n### VIII-C Unpredictability and Non-Repeatability\n\nThe rapid evolution of commercial and open source LLMs introduces significant unpredictability and non-repeatability in benchmark assessments. From a functionality standpoint, the frequent updates and model variations released by vendors make it difficult to ascertain whether a benchmark measures an LLM’s core capabilities or merely reflects transient optimizations tailored to the latest version. This instability undermines the benchmark’s ability to consistently evaluate reasoning, comprehension, or multimodal integration, as the results may vary with each model iteration. Regarding integrity, the evolving nature of LLMs opens avenues for potential manipulation, as vendors can modify models to perform well on known benchmarks without genuinely improving underlying capabilities. This dynamic can lead to misleadingly high benchmark scores that do not represent the LLM’s true functional performance in diverse, real-world scenarios. The lack of stable benchmarks complicates efforts to ensure that evaluations remain impartial and unaffected by superficial enhancements, thereby raising concerns about the authenticity of the assessments. Such issues require universally accepted, adaptable benchmarking frameworks that can accommodate the rapid advancements in LLM and generative AI, while providing reliable, repeatable measures of LLM performance. Without such standards, the evaluation landscape risks becoming fragmented and inconsistent, impeding the ability to accurately gauge the evolving capabilities of LLMs.\n\n### VIII-D Knowledge Boundaries in AI Benchmarking\n\nLLM benchmarks are constrained by the current limits of the benchmark creators’ human knowledge, hindering their ability to fully assess and cultivate emerging AI capabilities that may surpass conventional human understanding, potentially stalling innovation in fields that rely on advanced AI insights [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib4)]. Additionally, the lack of specialized domain knowledge among benchmark evaluators can compromise the benchmark integrity, as generalist approaches often fail to address the subtle requirements of critical sectors such as national security or healthcare. Such deficiency not only introduces benchmarking biases, but also creates vulnerabilities, allowing LLMs to take advantage of “benchmarks” created by people who do not fully understand the specific field. To address such challenges, benchmarks must evolve to include a broader knowledge base and involve evaluators with deep expertise in specialized fields, which is crucial for creating assessments that genuinely reflect the advanced capabilities of LLMs and possibly soon Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and are robust against manipulation. The rapid progression of LLMs requires LLM benchmarks that are as innovative and adaptable as the systems they evaluate, ensuring accurate measurement of LLM functionalities while maintaining integrity against evolving AI threats. Developing such benchmarks requires a concerted effort to integrate domain-specific knowledge into the evaluation process, ensuring that the assessments remain relevant and resilient in the face of AI’s advancing frontier.\n\n### VIII-E Challenges in Inclusive Benchmarking\n\nStandardizing benchmarks for LLMs faces significant challenges due to the diversity of human values and perspectives, which extend beyond linguistic, cultural, religious, and political realms to encompass a broad spectrum of societal norms and ethical considerations, and are sometimes conflicting and irreconcilable. The predominance of English and Simplified Chinese (overlooking Traditional Chinese differences) in those benchmarks frequently reflected the default values and beliefs of their creators, overlooking the pluralistic nature of global beliefs and practices. For example, the English and Simplified Chinese centrism in benchmarks like BIG-Bench [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib6)], and the focus on crystallized knowledge in MultiMedQA [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib10)] and ARB [[41](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib41)], highlighted such challenges, potentially disadvantaging LLMs not trained in those more prevalent languages and limiting assessments of their broader reasoning capabilities. Such a narrower focus would compromise the benchmarks’ ability to comprehensively and holistically evaluate LLMs, potentially favoring LLMs that aligned with specific cultural or ideological norms at the expense of broader applicability and acceptance, and raising concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs in the absence of cultural and ideological inclusivity. The reliance on standardized answers or rubrics exacerbated this issue, especially in assessments designed to gauge fairness, societal appropriateness, or ethical decision-making, where the rich tapestry of human diversity demanded a more sophisticated approach. Addressing the aforementioned challenges would require moving beyond technical fixes to incorporate ethical decision-making and cultural sensitivity, highlighting the need for benchmarks that facilitate the development of globally aware LLMs, acknowledging the vast array of human values [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib13)]. As the development of future LLM benchmarks progresses, it is anticipated that many will encounter similar challenges, particularly when the diversity of benchmark creators, evaluators, or the content itself does not fully embrace the broad spectrum of human diversity. However, different jurisdictions, religions, or cultures may have varying interpretations of inclusivity, ethics, or societal fairness that could lead to disagreements on what constitutes a superior LLM, which extends beyond technical benchmarks into broader considerations of values and politics.\n\n### VIII-F Limitations of This Study\n\nThis study, while aiming to provide a thorough critique of LLM benchmarks, encounters its own set of limitations. Firstly, our analysis inherently carries our subjective bias, a challenge we have attempted to mitigate by transparently listing our evaluative rationale in the Appendices. Due to the varying level of detail in benchmark descriptions, when we could not conclusively determine whether a study had acknowledged or addressed a specific benchmark inadequacy, or evaluate the correctness of questions and answers (which themselves could become outdated as technology and modern civilization evolves, and the study in [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib53)] found mislabeled or unanswerable examples within MMLU [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39)]), we opted to give these studies the benefit of the doubt, acknowledging the potential for possible oversight. Secondly, while only 5 out of the 23 surveyed benchmark studies were peer-reviewed, our critical inclusion of preprints should not be seen as diminishing their scientific contribution, although it highlighted the evolving and dynamic nature of research in this field. Thirdly, our decision not to attempt reproducing results from the surveyed benchmark studies, was informed by the substantial time and effort required, coupled with the challenge of LLM updates potentially altering outcomes during the lengthy evaluation process. Furthermore, while we addressed linguistic differences between Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese, we did not explore the subtle distinctions among various English dialects (e.g., American, British) and their inherent logical differences related to cultural attitudes, thereby acknowledging another layer of complexity in language-based evaluations. Lastly, the absence of specific regulations and guidelines for generative AI and LLMs, and a lack of public consensus on acceptable AI behaviors, constrained our ability to definitively enumerate all benchmark inadequacies. The evolving capabilities of advanced AI systems would require ongoing amendments to our critique, reflecting the dynamic nature of the field and the continuous emergence of new AI features.\n\n### VIII-G Future Research Direction: Extending Benchmarks with Behavioral Profiling and Regular Audits\n\nTo effectively evaluate and utilize LLMs amid the swift advancements in generative AI, their evaluation methods can be extended beyond traditional benchmarks to include both initial screenings and in-depth, ongoing assessments that align with changing technological and societal needs. Similar to the initial candidate selection and aptitude tests in the human recruitment process, traditional benchmarks can serve as the first filter to screen out LLMs that fail to meet basic competence levels, akin to identifying candidates who might be fraudulent, incompetent, non-compliant or otherwise unsuitable. This step ensures that only LLMs with a foundational level of proficiency and regulatory compliance proceed to more rigorous evaluations, optimizing resource allocation for subsequent stages of the assessment process.\n\nMirroring the interview stage of candidate selection, behavioral profiling explores deeper into the subtleties of LLM performance by assessing models beyond mere task completion, examining adaptability, ethical reasoning, and creativity in scenarios reflecting real-world complexities. Such AI behavioral analysis and profiling, a topic for future research, will prioritize LLMs most likely to fulfill specific roles or tasks, providing a sophisticated understanding of model capabilities and informing better selection decisions for deployment in sensitive or critical applications. Echoing the probation period in employment, regular audits post-deployment serve to continuously assess LLM performance against evolving standards and expectations. This step is crucial for catching any discrepancies between initial evaluations and actual performance, ensuring LLMs remain aligned with the requirements and ethical standards of evaluators and regulators over time. However, there are certain methodological limitations inherent in our approach. The subjective nature of benchmark evaluations, particularly when assessing more abstract qualities like adaptability or ethical reasoning, introduces potential bias. Additionally, the exclusion of certain benchmarks or evaluation frameworks may limit the generalizability of our findings. Future studies should address these gaps by exploring more objective, quantifiable methods for behavioral profiling and expanding the scope to include underrepresented benchmarks.\n\nGiven the rapid advancements in AI, our analysis risks becoming outdated as LLMs and benchmarking practices evolve. This highlights the need for ongoing research to continuously refine both the criteria and methods for LLM evaluation, ensuring they remain relevant and reflective of real-world complexities. Future research should focus on developing dynamic benchmarking systems that adapt to these changes, incorporating real-time audits and frequent updates to evaluation standards to capture the full scope of LLM capabilities and risks. Implementing this comprehensive evaluation framework will require collaboration across academia, industry, and regulatory bodies to develop standardized methodologies and ethical guidelines for each stage, ensuring assessments are rigorous and reflective of societal values and technological advancements. This will facilitate the creation of a dynamic evaluation ecosystem capable of adapting to the rapid pace of AI innovation and ensuring deployed LLMs are both effective and secure.\n\n## IX Conclusion\n\nThis study has critically analyzed 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, exposing significant inadequacies across technological, processual, and human dynamics that compromise their accuracy and reliability. The lack of standardized frameworks in AI benchmarking, unlike the established practices in regulated industries, has led to a proliferation of researcher-defined benchmarks that inadequately capture the complexity and evolving nature of LLMs. Our key contributions include: (i) formulating a unified evaluation framework rooted in cybersecurity principles to systematically identify and address deficiencies in benchmark design, focusing on functionality and integrity; (ii) conducting a detailed critique of 23 prominent LLM benchmarks, highlighting widespread issues that could impair comprehensive LLM assessment; and (iii) proposing the integration of LLM behavioral profiling and regular audits to enhance evaluation methodologies. As we arguably edge closer to the realization of AGI-like capabilities, it becomes crucial to rectify such benchmarking deficiencies, to ensure the responsible and secure deployment of LLMs. Furthermore, the lack of research consensus on how to properly benchmark LLMs, coupled with the academic liberty of releasing preprints, is likely to lead to a continued influx of question-and-answer sets self-claimed as benchmarks. It is therefore critical to point out their limitations and encourage deeper reflection within the research community. Our proposed extension of benchmarks with behavioral profiling and audits can provide a more subtle and rigorous evaluation of LLM capabilities and risks. Future work should prioritize the development of such benchmarks and establish standardized evaluation guidelines. We advocate for an international collaborative effort involving academia, industry, and regulatory bodies to continuously refine LLM benchmarks, aligning them with technological advancements and societal needs to ensure the development of robust and trustworthy AI systems.\n\n## References\n\n## Appendix A Examples of Benchmark Inadequacies in Technological Aspects\n\n### A-A Response Variability in Standardized Evaluations\n\nPrevalence: 22/23\n\nMMLU [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.09880v2#bib.bib39)]: The study designed a benchmark that focused on a wide range of tasks across different fields, like Professional Law and College Medicine.

Benchmarking is essential not only to gauge the progress of these models but also to ensure their reliability, fairness, and applicability across diverse tasks. This article explores the challenges associated with establishing benchmarks for LLMs and the complexities involved in measuring their performance.\n\n**Before diving in, make sure to check out my previous [comparative analysis](https://giancarlomori.substack.com/p/llm-comparative-analysis-key-metrics) of the top 5 LLMs.**\n\n## **Understanding LLM Benchmarks**\n\nLLM benchmarks are standardized tests or datasets designed to evaluate the performance of large language models on various tasks. These benchmarks provide a way to compare different models and track advancements in the field. They typically encompass a range of tasks, from natural language understanding and generation to more specialized applications like code generation and commonsense reasoning.\n\nThe primary purpose of LLM benchmarks is to provide a consistent and objective measure of a model’s capabilities. They help researchers and developers understand the strengths and weaknesses of different models, guiding further improvements and innovations. Benchmarks also play a crucial role in ensuring that models are robust, fair, and generalizable across different domains and applications.\n\n### **Defining the Top Benchmarks**\n\n## **The Challenges of Establishing LLM Benchmarks and Measuring LLMs**\n\n### **Diversity of Tasks**\n\nLLMs are utilized across a wide array of tasks, each with unique requirements and evaluation criteria. These tasks range from basic text generation and language translation to more complex functions such as summarization, question answering, code generation, and commonsense reasoning. The diversity in tasks makes it difficult to create benchmarks that comprehensively cover all aspects of LLM capabilities. Each task demands a different set of skills from the model, necessitating a variety of evaluation parameters to accurately measure performance.\n\nFor instance, a benchmark designed to assess text generation might focus on creativity and coherence, while a benchmark for translation would emphasize accuracy and fluency. Summarization tasks require models to condense information without losing context, which involves a different skill set. Creating a single benchmark that can effectively evaluate all these varied tasks poses a significant challenge.\n\n### **Dynamic Nature of Language**\n\nLanguage is not static; it constantly evolves. New slang, terminology, and usage patterns emerge regularly, influenced by cultural shifts, technological advancements, and social changes. This dynamic nature makes it challenging to develop static benchmarks that remain relevant over time. Benchmarks must be adaptable to capture the evolving nature of language and ensure that LLMs remain effective and accurate in their understanding and generation of text.\n\nConsider the rapid rise of internet slang and abbreviations. Once non-existent words and phrases have now entered common usage relatively quickly. A benchmark created a few years ago might not account for these terms, making it less effective in evaluating a model's current performance. Continuous updates to benchmarks are necessary to reflect these changes and provide accurate assessments of LLM capabilities.\n\n### Benchmarks vs. Metrics\n\nBefore continuing, it might be useful to define the difference between “benchmarks” and “metrics.” Here are simple definitions: **Benchmarks** include multiple tasks and use various metrics to provide a holistic evaluation of LLMs. **Metrics**, on the other hand, offer precise numerical scores for each task, facilitating detailed performance analysis and comparison.\n\nThese definitions will make digesting the rest of the article much easier.\n\n### **Evaluation Metrics**\n\nSelecting appropriate metrics to evaluate LLMs is a complex challenge. Traditional metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, BLEU, and ROUGE are commonly used to measure performance. However, these metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced aspects of language understanding and generation. They primarily focus on quantitative aspects and may not adequately reflect qualitative factors like coherence, creativity, and context understanding.\n\n**Examples of Metrics:**\n\n* **Precision and Recall:** Measure accuracy in information retrieval tasks.\n* **F1 Score:** Balances precision and recall.\n* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Commonly used for machine translation.\n* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Used for summarization tasks.\n\nDespite their widespread use, these metrics have limitations. For example, BLEU and ROUGE scores might not effectively capture the semantic accuracy and contextual appropriateness of translations and summaries. There is a need for more sophisticated evaluation methods that can assess the broader and deeper aspects of language processing, such as contextual relevance, user satisfaction, and conversational fluency.\n\n### **Bias and Fairness**\n\nEnsuring that benchmarks do not perpetuate biases is a critical challenge in the development and evaluation of LLMs. Biases related to gender, race, and culture can be embedded in the training data and, consequently, reflected in the model's outputs. Benchmarks must be designed to detect and mitigate these biases to ensure that LLMs provide fair and unbiased results.\n\nBias in LLMs can manifest in various ways, such as generating stereotypical responses or favoring certain demographic groups over others. For instance, a model might generate more positive descriptions for traditionally male-dominated professions while neglecting or misrepresenting female professionals. To address this, benchmarks need to include diverse and representative datasets and implement measures to identify and correct biased outputs.\n\n### **Scalability**\n\nAs LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, the scalability of benchmarks becomes a significant concern. Larger models require more computational resources for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. This increased demand poses challenges for researchers and developers in terms of time, cost, and technical infrastructure. Efficient testing protocols are essential to manage these constraints without compromising the thoroughness and accuracy of evaluations.\n\nEvaluating a model like GPT-4, which consists of billions of parameters, requires substantial computational power and time. The process of running comprehensive benchmarks on such large models can be resource-intensive, making it challenging to perform frequent and extensive evaluations. Developing scalable benchmarks that can handle the demands of increasingly complex models is crucial for maintaining the pace of innovation and ensuring robust performance assessments.\n\n## **Future Directions and Recommendations**\n\nTo address the current challenges in benchmarking LLMs, there is a pressing need for the development of innovative benchmarks that reflect the diverse and dynamic nature of language and its applications. These benchmarks should be designed to evaluate a broader spectrum of tasks and incorporate adaptive mechanisms that can evolve alongside advancements in language modeling.\n\nOne approach is to develop benchmarks with more diverse datasets, encompassing a wider range of languages, dialects, and cultural contexts. This would ensure that LLMs are evaluated on their ability to understand and generate text across different linguistic and cultural settings. Additionally, adaptive benchmarks that update periodically to include new linguistic phenomena, such as emerging slang or new technical jargon, can keep the evaluation process relevant and comprehensive.\n\n### **Improved Evaluation Metrics**\n\nExisting evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of language understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs. Therefore, there is a need for more sophisticated metrics that can provide a deeper and more nuanced assessment of LLM performance.\n\nFuture metrics should aim to capture aspects such as context, coherence, and creativity. For instance, metrics that evaluate contextual relevance could assess how well a model maintains context across long conversations or complex narratives. Coherence metrics could measure the logical flow and consistency of generated text, while creativity metrics might evaluate the novelty and originality of responses. Incorporating human-like scoring systems and integrating user feedback can also enhance the robustness and reliability of these evaluations.\n\n### **Addressing Bias**\n\nBias in LLMs remains a significant concern, and benchmarks must be designed to identify and mitigate these biases to ensure fair and unbiased outcomes. Effective strategies are needed to address biases related to gender, race, ethnicity, and culture that can inadvertently be propagated through LLMs.\n\nOne strategy is to use more representative datasets that include a diverse array of voices and perspectives. This can help ensure that LLMs are trained on a balanced set of data that reflects the broad spectrum of human experience. Additionally, implementing bias detection algorithms during the benchmarking process can identify biased outputs, allowing for corrective measures to be taken. Regular audits and updates of datasets and benchmarks to remove or mitigate biases are also crucial steps in this direction.\n\nBy developing innovative benchmarks, improving evaluation metrics, and addressing bias, the AI community can significantly enhance the benchmarking and performance evaluation of LLMs. These advancements will ensure that LLMs are not only technically proficient but also fair, reliable, and valuable across diverse real-world applications. The collaborative effort of researchers, developers, and stakeholders is essential to drive these improvements and shape the future of AI and language modeling.\n\n## **Charting the Future of LLM Evaluation**\n\nIn this piece, we explored the critical challenges associated with establishing benchmarks for LLMs and measuring their performance. Overcoming the challenges of benchmarking and evaluating LLMs is crucial for the advancement of artificial intelligence. Effective benchmarks ensure that LLMs are reliable, fair, and capable of handling diverse tasks in real-world scenarios.\n\nAs LLMs become more integrated into various applications, from customer service chatbots to automated translation and content creation, it is imperative that their performance is rigorously and comprehensively assessed. Addressing these challenges will lead to more robust, accurate, and unbiased LLMs, ultimately enhancing their utility and impact across different sectors.\n\nThe development of better benchmarks and evaluation methods for LLMs requires a collaborative effort from the AI community, but also extensive feedback from users at large. Researchers, developers, and stakeholders must work together to create innovative benchmarks that reflect the evolving nature of language and its applications. There is also a need to develop more sophisticated evaluation metrics that capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities and address inherent biases. By pooling resources and expertise, the AI community can drive the advancements needed to ensure that LLMs are not only cutting-edge but also ethical and equitable in their applications.\n\n---\n\n**Keep a lookout for the next edition of AI Uncovered.**\n\n**Follow on\xa0[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mvylassociates),\xa0[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mvyl-associates/?viewAsMember=true),\xa0and\xa0[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mvylassociates/)\xa0for more AI-related content!**\n\nThanks for reading AI Uncovered!

We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indica-tions on our bias benchmark (≈40% of com-parisons made by all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine pref-erences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 44%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with hu-mans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic an-notation aligned with human preferences.\n1 Introduction Large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) adapted to follow vari-ous kinds of instructions have been popularly uti-lized for several natural language tasks. The gen-eral standard for testing a model’s capabilities is benchmarking its performance on static evaluation suites such as Fan et al. (2019) and Wang et al.\n(2020). With the increased usage of language mod-els as general-purpose assistants and their artifi-cial nature (Das et al., 2024), current task-specific benchmarks are insufficient to measure the quality of generated texts in the wild.\n1Our project page: https://github.com/minnesotanlp/cobbler Recent studies have shown that LLMs can serve as evaluators themselves: Wu and Aji (2023) uti-lize LLMs as self-evaluators to automatically judge the quality of open-ended generations and compare them with human judgments via an Elo-score calcu-lation. Other works, such as AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023b), also utilize LLMs, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), as automatic evaluators to reduce the time and cost overhead of human annotations. As noted by these works, such automatic evaluation leader-boards have a number of limitations, including a preference for long outputs or outputs that are more similar to the evaluators’ generation qualities.\nIn this work, we propose COBBLER, the COgnitive Bias Benchmark for evaluating the qual-ity and reliability of LLMs as EvaluatoRs, as de-picted in Figure 1. We collect a set of 50 question-answering instructions from two well-established benchmarking datasets: BIGBENCH (Srivastava et al., 2023) and ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019).\nWe then generate responses from 16 open- and closed-source LLMs and conduct a round-robin over every possible unique pair between each of the model responses, prompting each model to evaluate its own and other models’ responses.\nWe then test six different biases to benchmark their evaluation quality and categorize the model biases into two groups: (1) Implicit Biases, which can be implicitly extracted from each model’s evaluation via a vanilla prompt, and (2) Induced Biases, which add modifications to the original prompts akin to induce negative behaviors. As shown in Figure 2, we find that the majority of the models strongly exhibit several of the different biases, which may compromise the credibility of their role as evaluators.2 Furthermore, we conduct experiments for human preferences by crowdsourc-ing six human annotators and collecting each of their rankings for a total of 300 annotations. From 2In total, 42K samples are analyzed across six biases for each model totaling 630K samples.\n517 Responses CoBBLEr ### Instruction: {instruction} ### Response: … x x x x 1.\n2.\n1.\n2.\nx … Models ### Instruction: {instruction} ### Reference: {ground-truth} ### System Star: {XSt} ### System Square: {XSq} ### Which one is better?

We find that most LLMs cannot perform as unbiased evaluators.\n• A comprehensive lineup of models (sizing from 3B to >175B parameters) as evaluators, encompassing the current state-of-the-art lan-guage models covering over 630k comparisons.\nFrom our benchmark, we find that most models exhibit various cognitive biases when used as au-tomatic evaluators, which may negatively impact evaluation quality. Thus, we propose our bench-mark (COBBLER) for measuring the capabilities of language models as evaluators to enable more re-liable evaluations that are well-aligned with human judgment.\nWe note that our use of biased and unbiased preferences does not allude to the ability to make completely impartial judgments but rather the am-plification of human-like biases within language models. As most models are tuned on human data, our study aims to estimate this gap between model and human judgment such that they can be refined more effectively to mitigate against these biases.\nAs such, we also aim for our benchmark to be ap-plied towards the development of future models, as in discovering new gaps or finding that existing gaps are still unresolved.\n2 Related Work LLMs as Evaluators.\nOwing to the effectiveness of LLMs, many recent research works have inves-tigated their utility in various downstream tasks, such as machine translation (Kocmi and Feder-mann, 2023), summarization (Shen et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023), code generation (Zhuo, 2023), writing assistance (Schick et al., 2023; Raheja et al., 2023), factual consistency (Cohen et al., 2023; Gekhman et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023), and more.\nAdditionally, many studies have leveraged LLMs for general-purpose NLG evaluation. For instance, Liu et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023); Wang et al.\n(2023a) investigated the effectiveness of GPT-4 and ChatGPT against reference-free evaluation meth-ods, whereas Fu et al. (2023) proposed an evalua-tion framework, GPTSCORE, to score generated texts. Recently, Li et al. (2023a) and Zheng et al.\n(2023) conducted similar experiments by employ-ing LLMs as evaluators to judge the quality of generations in a pairwise setting. Although these works present promising results for LLMs as au-tomatic evaluators, our work takes a closer look at machine artifacts that could be detrimental to data quality by benchmarking an exhaustive list of biases impacting LLMs-as-evaluators.\nLLM Evaluation Benchmarks.\nIt is becoming increasingly challenging to evaluate open-source LLMs as they become more powerful and perfor-mant. As a result, there has been an increasing need to develop better evaluation benchmarks for measuring the performance of LLMs. However, most of these benchmarks, such as LM-EVAL-HARNESS (Gao et al., 2021), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), HELM (Liang et al., 2022) and BIG-518 Bias Bias Behavior Example ORDER BIAS The tendency to give preference to an option based on their order (e.g. first, second, or last).\nSystem Star: x System Square: y System Square: y System Star: x COMPASSION FADE The tendency to observe different behaviors when given recognizable names as opposed to anonymized aliases.\nModel Alpaca: x Model Vicuna: y Model Vicuna: y Model Alpaca: x EGOCENTRIC BIAS The inclination to prioritize one’s own responses regard-less of response quality.\nModel Star (You): x Model Square: y SALIENCE BIAS The tendency to prefer responses based on the length of the response (i.e., more often preferring longer responses over shorter ones).\nSystem Star: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nSystem Square: The fox jumped.\nBANDWAGON EFFECT The tendency to prefer majority belief without critical evaluation.\n85% believe that System Star is better.\nATTENTIONAL BIAS The inclination to give more attention to irrelevant or unimportant details.\nSystem Square likes to eat oranges and ap-ples Table 1: We display the characteristic format for each bias and bold answers that indicate behavior influenced by the bias. For example, in COMPASSION FADE (recognizable names) Model Alpaca and Model Vicuna are associated with System Star and System Square respectively, in which the preferred response (bolded) is inconsistent with the preferred response from ORDER (anonymized names). Specific prompt details are viewed in Appendix C.\nBENCH (Srivastava et al., 2023), only focus on gen-eral LLM performance but do not explore their ca-pabilities as evaluators. Our work in this direction overlaps directly with Bai et al. (2023) and Zheng et al. (2023), who propose a Language-Model-as-an-Examiner benchmark and LLM-as-a-judge to study the capability of LLMs to emulate human preferences. While our experimental setups are similar, we highlight key differences. We cover a wider demographic of current popular language models and an overall different focus on QA as opposed to other domains such as math and rea-son. Furthermore, our benchmark emphasizes a wider range of biases (implicit/induced) to better describe machine artifacts when used as automatic evaluators. Specifically, COBBLER measures the extent to which each LM-as-evaluator is impacted in each decision by certain artifacts within prompts (i.e., prompting format, prompt information) over a comprehensive list of cognitive biases.\nCognitive Biases in LLMs.\nWhile biases have been well-known to exist in LLMs (Wang et al., 2023b; Talboy and Fuller, 2023; Wu and Aji, 2023), many recent works investigating the behaviors of LLMs have also uncovered similarities with cogni-tive biases. Some recent works (Zhao et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022) have shown that the order of training examples in GPT-3 could lead to differences in accuracy between near chance and near state-of-the-art. Jones and Steinhardt (2022) captured failures in GPT-3 and Codex and found that error patterns of LLMs resemble cognitive bi-ases in humans. Our work overlaps with these in some of the biases we cover, but we present a much more holistic and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs. Along this aspect, while our work is close to Wu and Aji (2023), who investigate biases related to fabricated factual and grammatical errors, our work is much more comprehensive in terms of the number of LLMs analyzed, the types of biases analyzed and the creation of an open benchmark.\n3 COBBLER: Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators The following criteria are used to select each type of evaluation bias: • General Applicability. Text evaluation tasks should be generalizable to most prompting sce-narios; tasks that observe too specific subtleties within the prompt are not helpful.\n• Impartiality. The prompt should not involve any leading statements to extract some desired quality of the evaluations • Memorylessness. The current evaluation in-stance should not rely on any previous behav-iors. Each instance should be self-contained when extracting each bias metric.\nWe carefully hand-select these biases based on the above three criteria such that they can be widely applicable to most evaluation settings in assessing the performance of LLMs as automatic evaluators.\n519 Table 1 summarizes definitions of each bias type along with examples in COBBLER. We categorize our benchmark into two main classes: (1) Implicit and (2) Induced Biases. For implicit biases, we feed a general prompt that shows system outputs in a pairwise manner to extract any biased behaviors within the model’s evaluations implicitly. For in-duced biases, we feed prompts geared towards each different bias, similar to adversarial attacks, such as presenting false information that may influence evaluator behaviors in a certain manner. Hence, we note that criterion 2 is not entirely fulfilled due to the nature of induced biases, though they can still be generally observable in an evaluation setting.\n3.1 Implicit Biases We categorize biases as “implicit” if they can be witnessed without including any additional infor-mation other than instructing the model to judge the quality of two given generated texts.\nOrder Bias is an evaluation bias we observe when a model tends to favor the model based on the order of the responses rather than their content quality. Order bias has been extensively studied (Jung et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al., 2023), and it is well-known that language models can be influenced by the ordering of the responses in their evaluations. We prompt both orderings of each pair and count the evaluation as a “first order” or “last order” bias if the evaluator chooses the first ordered (or last ordered) output in both arrangements respectively.\nCompassion Fade (Naming).\n(Butts et al., 2019; Västfjäll et al., 2014) is a cognitive bias that denotes a decrease in empathy as the number of identifiable individuals increases. To this phe-nomenon, we modify the definition for our use case to measure whether model evaluations are affected by real/identifiable names as opposed to evalua-tions with anonymous aliases (e.g. System A).\nSpecifically, an unbiased evaluator would make evaluations similar to when anonymized names were presented.\nEgocentric Bias (Self-Preference). (Ross and Sicoly, 1979) is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency to have a higher opinion of oneself or to more easily accept ideas if they match one’s own. We define an evaluator to be egocentrically biased if, for each instance, the evaluator prefers its own response over others. We note that an unbi-ased evaluator would choose between themselves and other comparand models equally in propor-tion. However, we highlight that some models would naturally generate higher quality responses (e.g., GPT4 vs. KOALA), resulting in a stronger inclination for such evaluators to choose their own responses.\nSalience Bias (Length). (Schenk, 2010; Zheng et al., 2023) The evaluator tends to favor responses that are either shorter or longer in length. An un-biased evaluator would be split evenly between re-sponses that are shorter or longer in length. We ex-amine this bias by looking at evaluations in which a model preferred a response that is either shorter or longer in token length.\n3.2 Induced Biases We categorize a bias as “induced” when it requires modifications to the primary prompt or the inclu-sion of additional information with the original instructions. We specifically look to test the ro-bustness of each of the models as evaluators by introducing false or off-topic information and ex-amining the impact that these setups have on the quality of their evaluations. For both biases below, we would expect an unbiased evaluator to gener-ally pick responses highlighted by BANDWAGON and ATTENTIONAL ∼25% of the time (calculated RANDOM threshold).\nBandwagon Effect. (Schmitt-Beck, 2015) The evaluator’s preferences are influenced by the col-lective preference rather than being based on their own independent judgments. We add an additional sentence after the initial instruction stating a fake statistic by choosing one of the comparand out-puts as preferred by a majority of people, such as “85% believe that System Star is better.”. We count the model to be influenced by BANDWAGON if the evaluator choose the model stated in the statistic.\nAttentional Bias (Distraction). In addition to the original instruction, we follow a similar setup from (Shi et al., 2023) where we include irrelevant information about one of the comparand models to test the ability of evaluators. For example, we include a meaningless sentence such as ”System Star likes to eat oranges and apples.” We identify the evaluator to be distracted if it prefers the model mentioned in the distraction or if its valid response rate significantly drops.\n520 4 Experiment Setup In this section, we discuss our evaluation frame-work for benchmarking each of the different biases in LLMs as evaluators for text quality comparison.\n4.1 Datasets and Models Datasets We choose two widely used datasets (Eli5 (Fan et al., 2019) and BigBench (strate-gyQA)) (Geva et al., 2021; Srivastava et al., 2023)) employed to train and benchmark instruction-tuned models, creating a set of 50 question-answering instructions (taking 25 random instructions from each). We specifically choose corpora from the Question-Answering (Q/A) domain for ease of use in generating responses. As we are looking to test the ability of language models to perform as un-biased evaluators to judge response quality and correctness, the Q/A response format presents the most natural setting for these comparisons.\nModels We assemble 16 popular models based on the HuggingFace OpenLLM leaderboard (Beeching et al., 2023), API-based models, and recent open-source models: • (>100B parameters): GPT-4, CHATGPT, IN-STRUCTGPT (OpenAI, 2023) • (>40B parameters): LLAMAV2 (Touvron et al., 2023), LLAMA (Touvron et al., 2023), COHERE, FALCON (Almazrouei et al., 2023) • (>10B parameters): ALPACA (Taori et al., 2023), VICUNA (Chiang et al., 2023), OPENAS-SISTANT (Köpf et al., 2023) • (<10B parameters): MISTRAL-INSTRUCT (Jiang et al., 2023), OLMO (Groeneveld et al., 2024),BAIZE (Xu et al., 2023b), KOALA (Geng et al., 2023), WIZARDLM (Xu et al., 2023a), MPT (Team, 2023) 4.2 Text Evaluation Setting Response Generation Figure 1 demonstrates our generation and evaluation pipeline for COBBLER.\nHere, we define “models” and “evaluators” inter-changeably. We first generate the responses from each model by prompting 50 instructions from the combined dataset for a total of 800 generations.\nPairwise Evaluation After we collect all the model responses, we then prompt each evaluator to compare the anonymized generations in a pair-wise manner. We generate all \x0015 2 \x01 unique pairs amongst all models3 for each of the 50 instruc-tions, creating a total of 5250 examples for each evaluator to rank. We then prompt the evaluator to compare generations based on the coherence of each of the responses in terms of correctness of content and alignment to the instruction/reference provided. The evaluation prompts for each bias benchmark are viewable in Appendix C. To miti-gate against potential confounding factors, we run each pairwise instance twice in both arrangements to validate consistent behavior.\nAdditionally, we conduct a list-wise ranking amongst 4 models. However, we find that most LLMs of size <40B have trouble generating a valid list of rankings (Appendix B) due to increased task complexity (Dziri et al., 2023).\nBenchmarking As the comparisons are limited to a pair-wise fashion, we empirically calculate a ”bias threshold” via random selection. For exam-ple, in the ORDER benchmark, each pair is evalu-ated twice in which both orderings are viewed (i.e.\nSystem Star is shown ordered first, then Sys-tem Square is shown ordered first). We then randomly select a model in each response pair and measure the percentage of where the first-ordered model is chosen in both arrangements; models above random thresholds are identified to exhibit the said bias.\nThe random threshold provides a rough basis for the proportion of evaluations, for example, with respect to Order bias, which would be labeled “first order bias” if one randomly selects a response. We make this assumption to serve as a “litmus test” in distinguishing established patterns with respect to “bias/unbiased” evaluations by automatic evalua-tors rather than just random selection when models are noticeably above or below this threshold for each of our benchmark modules. We conduct a statistical test in Appendix B.5 to determine the sig-nificance of each proportion of biased evaluations from each automatic evaluator with the random baseline.\n4.3 Human Preference Study We collected human preferences from six work-ers on Amazon mechanical Turk (AMT) platform.\nMore details about our data collection, human an-notation process, and Rank-Biased Overlap and our calculation process are presented in Appendix D.\n3We say all pairs from 15 models, as LLAMAV2 was added later, which alone evaluated \x0016 2 \x01 unique pairs 521 CoEdIT(XL) CoEdIT(XXL) CoEdIT(L) InstructGPT GPT3 T0++ PEER(3B) T0 Tk-instruct * DELIteraTeR LLaMA Alpaca IteraTeR * PEER(11B) * * * * * * * LLaMAv2 InstructGPT ChatGPT Alpaca GPT-4 LLaMA Falcon Cohere OpenAssist Vicuna Koala WizardLM Baize MPT Random: 0.28 OLMO Mistral (a) Average bias scores by model size CoEdIT(XL) CoEdIT(XXL) CoEdIT(L) InstructGPT GPT3 T0++ PEER(3B) T0 Tk-instruct * DELIteraTeR LLaMA Alpaca IteraTeR * PEER(11B) * * * * * * * * InstructGPT ChatGPT GPT-4 LLaMA Redpajama Falcon Cohere OpenAssist Vicuna Koala WizardLM Baize MPT Random: 0.28 Random: 0.28 (b) Breakdown of the proportional impact of each bias Figure 2: Overview of major findings (lower score indicates "less biased" or better performance) of evaluator capabilities on all bias benchmarks. The red-dotted line denotes the average RANDOM threshold across each bias.\nModels highlighted red indicate ones with < 80% valid evaluations on 2 or more of the benchmarks.\nAgreement between Human Preference and LLM Evaluation We calculated the Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score (Webber et al., 2010) to measure the agreement between human prefer-ences and model evaluations in ranking-generated texts across 16 different LLMs. RBO, which can vary from 0 (non-conjoint) to 1 (identical), assigns more weight to the top k items in the ranked lists being compared 4. Higher RBO score means higher agreement. Further mathematical details of RBO setup can be found in Appendix D.2. To properly compare machine and human preferences, we con-struct a ranked list for each evaluator by counting each model wins5 from every pairwise comparison and then calculated the RBO. Here, we computed the RBOs between each individual annotator and machine preferences and averaged them.\nIdentifying Biases in Pairwise Human Prefer-ence To validate the gap between model judg-ment and humans, we conduct another study to measure the degree of bias in human evaluations as well. We mirror the pairwise model evaluation set-ting from Section 4.2 for ORDER BIAS, SALIENCE BIAS, BANDWAGON EFFECT, and ATTENTIONAL BIAS for a separate human study. To obtain an 4We concentrated 86% of all weights on the top 5 list positions, following Webber et al. (2010).\n5At the time of human experiments, LLAMA2, MISTRAL, and OLMO were added later and instead involved responses by REDPAJAMA and DOLLY. Thus, the ranking of those three models was not included involving pairwise comparisons between 13 models.\neffective metric, and due to the vastness of the pairwise model comparison settings, we randomly sampled 750 pairs from 25 different instructions.\nWe then calculate the average IAA for each bias via RBO and then compute the average bias propor-tion across all annotators to highlight the overall influence of each bias on human judgment.\nTo maintain consistency with the initial study, where we used RBO as an IAA metric among human annotators for the previous N-wise rank-ing human experiment, we employed the same ap-proach for the pairwise human bias experiment as opposed to Fleiss’ Kappa or other pairwise agree-ment scores. This involved converting all pairwise rankings by humans into a ranked list of models and computing the IAA scores among the human annotators for each of the three bias experiments.\nHowever, we randomly paired models for each in-struction and thus generated 750 model pairs per bias 6, with some models appearing either multi-ple times or none in those pairs. As some models may be overrepresented, we compensate for the absence of some models by applying a normaliza-tion to the rankings of appearing models across all judged pairs per human annotator. More details are described in Appendix D.3, D.4, and D.5.\n6Note that there are 25 batches in total for 750 pairs per bias and 75 human annotators 522 Model Size ORDER COMP.\nEGOC.\nSAL.\nBAND.\nATTN.\nFirst Last First Last Order Comp.\nRANDOM -0.24 0.25 0.24 0.25 0.24 0.24 0.5 0.25 0.25 GPT4 -0.17 0.06 0.46 0.33 0.78 0.06 0.56 0.0 0.0 CHATGPT 175B 0.38 0.03 0.41 0.25 0.58 0.17 0.63 0.86 0.06 INSTRUCTGPT 175B 0.14 0.24 0.29 0.19 0.28 0.27 0.66 0.85 0.54 LLAMAV2 70B 0.47 0.08 0.09 0.17 0.06 0.0 0.62 0.04 0.03 LLAMA 65B 0.61 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.02 0.42 0.0 0.01 COHERE 54B 0.33 0.17 0.38 0.27 0.27 0.15 0.60 0.82 0.14 FALCON 40B 0.74 0.03 0.09 0.18 0.05 0.11 0.59 0.28 0.40 ALPACA 13B 0.0 0.82 0.23 0.29 0.18 0.39 0.47 0.75 0.81 VICUNA 13B 0.32 0.17 0.17 0.15 0.27 0.45 0.53 0.81 0.78 OPENASSIST 12B 0.56 0.11 0.03 0.22 0.15 0.06 0.49 0.72 0.82 MISTRAL 7B 0.42 0.04 0.33 0.23 0.30 0.03 0.57 0.54 0.02 OLMO 7B 0.66 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.38 0.83 0.46 BAIZE 7B 0.0 0.95 0.21 0.32 0.02 0.36 0.49 0.82 0.24 KOALA 7B 0.24 0.01 0.0 0.11 0.48 0.86 0.55 0.13 0.10 WIZARDLM 7B 0.08 0.64 0.22 0.34 0.14 0.29 0.53 0.76 0.27 MPT 7B 0.49 0.1 0.11 0.27 0.21 0.25 0.63 0.95 0.52 Table 2: A comparison of 16 models with different ranges of model sizes across six different bias benchmarks. A higher proportion indicates worse (more biased) performance. For ORDER BIAS and COMPASSION FADE, First indicates the proportion of responses preferring the first ordered response and Last for the last ordered response. For SALIENCE BIAS, models with scores less than 0.5 prefer responses with fewer tokens, and scores above 0.5 prefer responses with more tokens. The background color of each metric is determined by the difference between the value and the corresponding RANDOM metric (darker shade indicates stronger bias).\n5 Results and Discussion For each bias, we analyze the performance of each of the 16 models as evaluators. We provide a vi-sual breakdown of the proportional impact of the average performance of each model as unbiased evaluators in Fig. 2 based on the results relative to the RANDOM baseline in Table 2. On average, we see that models within the 10B size range are most affected by each bias benchmark in Fig. 2a.\nNotably, we see that the implicit biases contribute similarly to each models’ overall bias scores, in-dicating that scaling model size does not reduce implicit biases in evaluators.\n5.1 Bias Analysis Implicit Biases We first examine the perfor-mance of each evaluator on the implicit bias bench-marks for ORDER BIAS, COMPASSION FADE, SALIENCE BIAS and EGOCENTRIC BIAS. For the ORDER BIAS benchmark in Table 2, we observe that most models (11/15) tend to be drawn towards either the first- or last-ordered model in each of the pairwise comparisons. Notably, within the second size group (>40B), the first-ordered system was strongly favored in over 50%.\nFor COMPASSION FADE, since it is difficult to interpret its impact by the metrics independently, we jointly compare the results with the ones from ORDER BIAS. For an unbiased evaluator that is not influenced by identifiable names, we expect the results for COMPASSION FADE to be relatively similar to the ORDER BIAS benchmark. However, we see in Table 2 that all models are dramatically influenced by real model names. Although this phe-nomenon may be akin to injecting random names, the disparity between ORDER and COMPASSION FADE results support our hypothesis that recog-nizable names influence evaluations in contrast to anonymized ones. In addition, we also note that OLMO sees a drastic decrease in performance. This might be attributed to the model’s inability to fol-low more complex instructions from its training.\nFor EGOCENTRIC BIAS, in the anonymized aliases, the largest models as well as KOALA tend to prefer their own responses (> 50%) with the exception of INSTRUCTGPT. However, with real model names (COMPASSION), we see a large drop in self-preference for models in the largest size group (>100B) models, but this may be attributed to a large increase in bias for each position. On average, we see an increase in self-preference with real model names amongst the two smaller size groups, notably KOALA sees a 100% increase in preference.\n523 Model Salience Saliencelarge Saliencesmall GPT4 0.56 0.71 0.46 CHATGPT 0.63 0.84 0.56 LLAMAV2 0.62 0.75 0.53 COHERE 0.60 0.71 0.56 VICUNA 0.53 0.57 0.51 MISTRAL 0.57 0.68 0.50 OLMO 0.38 0.45 0.29 Table 3: SALIENCE of selected models preferring gen-erations from large models vs. small models. We see only small deviations in preference of large and small models’ generations with respect to saliency.\nFor SALIENCE BIAS, we observe that the larger models in the first and second size groups are more strongly affected by longer responses, which align with findings from other works (Wu and Aji, 2023; Zheng et al., 2023). However, smaller models (ex-cluding MPT) tend to be less influenced by the length of the responses, suggesting that smaller models in the third and fourth size groups are less impacted in their evaluations in consideration of the length of the text.\nFor models such as ChatGPT, the EGOCENTRIC BIAS may be unfair because their generations are indeed better, or in SALIENCE, the longer genera-tions indeed have higher quality. For further insight in decoupling these factors, we include supplemen-tary experiments viewed in Appendix B.\n5.1.1 Identifying Egocentric and Salience Bias We also discuss the evaluation criteria for identi-fying EGOCENTRIC and SALIENCE biases, which may be more appropriately evaluated conditioned on underlying generation quality and model size.\nWe select a few model representative models for clarity viewed in Table 3. Generally, most models stay consistent with their preference for longer/shorter responses conditioned on either gen-eration’s quality, although some flip their prefer-ences (to only a small effect however). For fur-ther insight, we compute the generation quality us-ing reference-based metrics via BERTScore. From this, all models produce nearly the same quality of generations with respect to the reference answer (∼0.81 to 0.86 for F1), highlighting that identify-ing EGOCENTRIC or SALIENCE bias is most likely not dependent on generation quality.\nInduced Biases Next, we evaluate the perfor-mance of each evaluator on the induced bias bench-marks: BANDWAGON EFFECT and ATTENTIONAL BIAS. For BANDWAGON EFFECT, we observe that almost all models (11/15) are heavily influenced in which > 70% of evaluations on average followed the bandwagon preference regardless of text quality.\nAlthough we only included a simple fake statistic (e.g. 85% of people preferred “System Star“), we see that evaluators can be heavily influenced by this external information. To observe a correlation between the biased tendency and the percentage, we include additional results in Appendix B.1 For ATTENTIONAL BIAS, we see that around half of the models’ rankings are influenced by irrelevant information. Specifically, we see that models in the third size group (>10B) were the most strongly impacted by the distracting informa-tion, with > 80% of evaluations being counted as distracted. On the other hand, API-based models such as CHATGPT and COHERE remained robust against these distractions in their rankings. We in-clude the list of distractions we use in Appendix C.\nLastly, we address specific models such as LLA-MAV2, LLAMA, KOALA, and OLMO that show abnormal results on most of the benchmarks. This can be attributed to their low valid response rates, displayed in Table 12 in Appendix B, which may be explained by our prompting format or the capabili-ties of the model themselves, likely as they are not instruction-tuned. Although these models display lower performance when extracting evaluations, if a model is not strong enough to produce valid outputs, we assume those models are not strong enough to be used for evaluations. And as we don’t consider invalid responses within the study, we only apply our findings to ones that produced valid eval-uations, in which most models exhibit cognitive biases from our benchmark. Although the corre-lation between valid response rates and bias can provide more insight into model capabilities, it is not within the scope of our findings.\n5.2 Agreement Between Human Preferences and Model Evaluations N-rankwise Human Preference (N=13) The av-erage RBO among the six AMT workers is 0.54, which signifies a modest but reasonable consen-sus among workers in ranking the LLM outputs, given the challenges of ranking all LLM-generated outputs. From this, we calculate the average RBO between human and model preferences to be 0.44, indicating that model evaluations do not closely align with human preferences.\nFigure 3 presents the average RBO scores be-524 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Avg.

We show the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) scores be-tween aggregated human preferences and each of the 16 LLMs. Higher RBO means higher similarity.\ntween a model and each of human preferences.\nWhile MISTRAL and CHATGPT achieved the high-est RBO scores, most of the remaining models demonstrated lower agreement with human prefer-ences. Smaller models also tend to misalign with an overall human preference, as the average RBO of models of size greater or smaller than 10B are 0.37 and 0.41, respectively, compared to >40B (0.49) and >100B (0.48).\nFurthermore, we present additional results on the variance of pairwise RBOs based on our anno-tations by six human annotators for the N=13-wise ranking experiment. Table 5 presents that the vari-ance of all pairwise RBOs among humans is 0.004, indicating minimal disparity amongst all annota-tors. It is more clearly observed that any pairwise RBO between two annotators is higher than the average agreement between humans and models (0.44).\nBias in Pairwise Human Preference The aver-age RBO scores were 0.39 (ORDER BIAS), 0.50 (BANDWAGON EFFECT), and 0.43 (ATTENTIONAL BIAS), indicating modest agreement 7 amongst hu-man annotators in a pairwise selection setting. The average proportion of biased responses across all human annotators for ORDER BIAS, SALIENCE BIAS, BANDWAGON EFFECT, and ATTENTIONAL BIAS are presented in Table 4. Compared to hu-mans, VICUNA shows higher or similar bias pro-portions on all of the four bias types, where its 7Note that we considered these scores, which might ini-tially appear low, as relatively high when considering the impact of biases that can affect individuals to varying degrees.\nORDER SALIE.\nBANDW.\nATTEN.\nHUMAN 0.20 0.52 0.47 0.35 VICUNA 0.32 0.53 0.81 0.78 Table 4: Comparison of Human bias vs. Vicuna for the proportion of biased evaluations.

We see the agreement between each worker is in general much higher than the agreement between human and LLMs (0.44).\nATTENTIONAL BIAS proportion particularly ex-ceeds humans by more than twice.\nWe view that humans still exhibit biases when making their preferences on pairwise LLM evalu-ations, but less than LLM evaluators on average.\nSimilarly, on the induced bias benchmarks, humans were less affected by BANDWAGON EFFECT and ATTENTIONAL bias, highlighting a prevalent gap between model judgment capabilities and human ones, in which human-like biases are more intensi-fied.\n6 Conclusion In this paper, we analyze 16 recently developed LLMs for their suitability as automatic text quality annotators in Q/A settings. We introduce a new benchmark COBBLER to assess their evaluation performance against 1) Implicit and 2) Induced biases. Additionally, we compare LLM evaluations to human preferences and find only a 44% average agreement. Our results indicate that most LLMs exhibit cognitive biases to a greater extent than hu-mans, suggesting that LLMs are still unsuitable as fair and reliable automatic evaluators. In the future, potential de-biasing methods provide another area of interest in reducing each bias. For example, tech-niques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or other alignment methods can perhaps be employed to reduce the bias for current models.\n525 Limitations We acknowledge a few limitations within our study.\nSome models reach very low valid response rates, which may be due to the prompting format. With model-specific prompts, we may be able to extract more clear results for each bias. Additionally, we address the fairly subpar IAA within our human judgment study. This may be due to the difficulty of the task, asking MTurk annotators to rank 15 mod-els to limit the number of comparisons required in a pairwise format, but also increases the complex-ity of the task itself, which may have caused lower quality in the annotations.\nWe also highlight the stability of our findings in the long term. As LLM research is rapidly grow-ing, the capabilities of language models can scale exponentially with time. As such, with new de-velopments being discovered frequently, previous LLM performance on our bias benchmarks may quickly become outdated (i.e. INSTRUCTGPT can be considered an "outdated LLM," as the API is also no longer offered on OpenAI’s platforms).\nAcknowledgements This work was mainly supported by the research gift from Grammarly.

Large language models are state-of-the-art evaluators of code generation.\n529 A Experimental Setup A.1 Model Hyperparameters We set the same hyperparameters across models for each evaluation generation and response generation for consistency across all of the models. We limit the max new tokens generated to 128 tokens and set the temperature to 1.0. For Huggingface models, we set a repetition penalty of 1.2 and set the number of beams to 3.\nA.2 Experimental Settings For models that are supported (ChatGPT, Instruct-GPT, GPT-4, Vicuna), we utilize Microsoft Guid-ance to better control LLM generations. Otherwise, we utilize the transformer pipeline library from Hugginface to retrieve each evaluation generation.\nRegardless of whether a models generation was collected from guidance or using the transformer pipeline, all parameters were the same. Model gen-eration times for response generation ranged from 1 to 8 hours, and for evaluation generations ranged from 3 to 24 hours for each bias benchmark. All experiments were run on either A5000 or A6000 GPUs for models under 40B parameters. For mod-els over 40B, A100 GPUs were utilized if an API service was not available (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere).\nA.3 Datasets Eli5 (Fan et al., 2019) is a long-form question-answering dataset constructed from 270k threads from the “Explain Like I’m Five” Reddit forum.\nThe online forum consists of a community for in-dividuals to ask various questions, and answers are provided in a format that is comprehensible to five-year-olds, along with assigned scores based on community votes. For our purposes, we only uti-lize the questions and their highest-rated answers to generate responses and benchmark automatic evaluators for text-generation quality.\nBigBench (Srivastava et al., 2023) is a collec-tion of benchmarks that look to probe the abilities of language models over a diverse range of tasks.\nWe specifically utilize the strategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) dataset, which was constructed by crowd-sourcing questions from writers as well as their responses with short justifications. We choose the strategyQA dataset to generate responses that re-quire multi-step reasoning to effectively benchmark the ability of models to comprehend and compare the quality between two different explanations.\nB Supplementary Results B.1 Correlation between BANDWAGON and Percentage In an additional experiment, we show a modified statistic for the biased model: "0% of people prefer {model}.” If bias tendency were in-deed correlated with the statistic, we would ex-pect the evaluator model to have 0 preference for bandwagon response. Due to limited computation resources and time, we ran the additional experi-ments for two representative models at each size range (+ all API-based models) and presented the results below in Table 6.\nHere, one can observe that the preference choices for the bandwagon statistic greatly change (besides GPT4 and VICUNA) which suggests that indeed the biased tendency is correlated with the bandwagon statistic. However, we see that VI-CUNA, in particular, is not greatly affected by the statistics. This suggests that within the prompt, the model only focuses on the phrase “people believe that {model} is better” in-stead of the statistic. Similarly, this may be the case for Alpaca and InstructGPT as well. We also present the results of the bandwagon test by ran-domly choosing a percentage between 50% and 85% in Table 7. We continue see that most models demonstrate biased tendencies.\nB.2 Diverse Prompts We additionally ask each evaluator to analyze generation quality along several different aspects such as “coherence, accuracy, factu-ality, and helpfulness” following (Bai et al., 2023) and (Zheng et al., 2023). As opposed to our single-aspect format in the main section, we conjecture that these cognitive biases remain re-gardless of evaluation aspects. To validate this, we constructed an extended prompt viewable in C.5 that incorporates different dimensions of evalua-tion criteria into our pairwise evaluation prompt and reported their results in Table 8 on the ORDER benchmark. We see that by including diverse per-spectives in the evaluation setting, some metrics become more pronounced (i.e. COHERE for EGO-CENTRIC) or bias decreases (i.e. VICUNA for EGO-CENTRIC). However, we see that the proportion of biased evaluations stays relatively consistent for most models on all benchmarks. Hence, our find-ings remain that models still show a large skewness in bias tendency as evaluators.\n530 Models GPT-4 CHATGPT INSTUCTGPT COHERE ALPACA VICUNA BAIZE WIZARDLM BANDWAGON (85%) 0.0 0.86 0.85 0.82 0.75 0.81 0.82 0.76 BANDWAGON (0%) 0.0 0.0 0.56 0.0 0.52 0.79 0.32 0.27 Table 6: BANDWAGON test showing a fake statistic stating 0% of people prefer the chosen response.\nModels GPT-4 CHATGPT INSTUCTGPT COHERE ALPACA VICUNA BAIZE WIZARDLM BANDWAGON (85%) 0.0 0.86 0.85 0.82 0.75 0.81 0.82 0.76 BANDWAGON (50-85%) 0.06 0.70 0.84 0.65 0.68 0.96 0.75 0.76 Table 7: BANDWAGON test showing a fake statistic stating (randomly) between 50 −80% of people prefer the chosen response.\nB.3 Prompting with Ties We present a modified version of the prompt in B.3 that considers ties in each pairwise preference.\nNote that for SALIENCE, if a pairwise sample was labeled as “Tie,” we do not consider it for length bias. From Table 9 we see that the inclusion of the tie option does view a considerable change in the bias benchmarks. Notably, the strongest and smallest models (GPT-4, CHATGPT, BAIZE, WIZARDLM) do not exhibit any change. How-ever, we see that the mid-range models (ALPACA, VICUNA) and INSTRUCTGPT display a large pref-erence for assigning the tie label (≥∼90%) that does not present any valid results, to which we had originally only prompted two options for each evaluator to avoid this issue. The only model that demonstrated an improvement from previous bias behavior was COHERE.\nB.4 Decoupling Confounding Factors We particularly focus on decoupling EGOCENTRIC and Salience, which are the most prone to having large correlations with each other (i.e. longer gen-erations may indeed have overall higher quality generated by much stronger models).We highlight two important aspects regarding the identification of these biases: • If multiple models have a large proportion of evaluations preferring their own responses (as the evaluated pool of pairwise instances is the same for each evaluator), we reason that this may suggest “egocentric” qualities within in-volved evaluators, regardless of the objective strength of the models. Moreover, we see this effect is especially demonstrated between the more powerful models as well (GPT4 & CHAT-GPT) that suggest the presence of EGOCEN-TRIC evaluations from their disagreement.\n• We employ various strategies to mitigate these confounding variables and isolate each analysis as much as possible. For example, we employ a “hierarchical” rubric, where some biases take priority in an evaluation. Specifically, if an eval-uation shows signs of order bias by choosing A in (A first, then B) and B in (B first, then A), we do not evaluate it for SALIENCE or EGOCEN-TRIC bias.\nTo get further insight into decoupling them, we examine additional statistics in Table 11 display-ing the proportion of EGOCENTRIC samples where the model’s generation was longer/shorter than the other generation. In particular, since OLMO only won once, and LLAMA never won, their EGOCEN-TRIC ratios look weird. Otherwise, we view overall that most models (9/16) exhibit a self-preference for their own generations often when their own generations exhibit longer token length.\nAs above, we see that SALIENCE may be asso-ciated with higher quality generations, as we see that the strongest models (GPT4, ChatGPT) often prefer their own responses when their generations are longer. Nevertheless, even in smaller models (e.g., Cohere, Koala), preference for their own gen-erations occurs more often when they are longer.\nHowever, as we previously emphasized, if multiple models observe a self-preference for their own gen-erations, it is difficult to associate with SALIENCE as there is disagreement that is indicative of an EGOCENTRIC bias.\n531 MODELS GPT-4 CHATGPT INSTUCTGPT COHERE ALPACA VICUNA BAIZE WIZARDLM ORDER (COH.) 0.17F 0.38F 0.24L 0.33F 0.82L 0.32F 0.95L 0.64L ORDER (DIV.) 0.14F 0.45F 0.22L 0.23L 0.76L 0.52F 0.83L 0.68L EGOCENT.

For visual clarity, we only display the bias ratio with the highest proportion and denote with subscript xF or xL for first- or last-ordered bias, respectively.\nB.5 Significance of Results We adapt two statistical hypothesis tests based on the random bias threshold for the Order bias (first-order and last-order) benchmark in Table 10. Since we have binary outputs (bias, not biased), we con-duct a two-sample Z test of proportions to deter-mine the significance of each proportion of biased evaluations from each automatic evaluator with the random baseline. We conduct the test with the null hypothesis defined to be that “evaluator X is just as likely to make the mistake of flipping its prefer-ence according to the order of the response to the first-order as the random baseline” or equivalently: H0: the mean of Evaluator X for first-order bias is not any different from random selection.\nOn almost all of the ORDER benchmarks, the proportions of biased evaluations are statistically significant from ones by the random score. Notably, the p-values are critically small (z-scores are blown up) due to our large sample size. Also, we note that the p-value is actually not statistically signif-icant for last-order bias in InstructGPT; however, the first-order proportions are statistically signifi-cant, indicating that one must consider the test for both positions to get the full picture of the evalu-ator’s tendencies in reference to the random base-line. For example, if both first-order and last-order were not statistically significant from the random proportions, we might find that the evaluator is “un-biased,” but the following may also undermine the capabilities of the automatic evaluator reduced to just random choice.\nB.6 LLM Performance and Agreement We detail the general agreement between machine preferences as similarly conducted in the human-machine correlation study. Figure 5 visualizes the average Rank-Based Overlap between LLMs. We find that LLMs in their own size group (exclud-ing the smallest size group) have a relative agree-ment with each other. For example, models in the largest size group (>100B) are more in agreement amongst themselves than with models from other size groups. Furthermore, we also show the aver-age valid response rate from different bias prompt-ings in Table 12. We gather the proportion of valid responses by post-processing each “eval-gen” via pattern matching. After post-processing, we then label each output as a valid or invalid response, such that if a response is valid, we give one point to the preferred system.\nB.7 Model Size We conduct a supplementary experiment analyz-ing the impact of each bias for different models scaled by size in Table 13. We present results from a range of model sizes with LLAMAV2 and VI-532 MODEL FIRST ORDER Z-SCORE FIRST ORDER P-VALUE LAST ORDER Z-SCORE LAST ORDER P-VALUE GPT-4 8.45 2.82e−17 26.55 2.65e−155 CHATGPT −15.61 6.68e−55 32.43 9.50e−231 INSTRUCTGPT 13.04 7.08e−39 1.17 2.4e−1 LLAMAV2 −33.12 1.30e−240 17.97 3.53e−72 LLAMA −40.84 0 15.36 2.95e−53 COHERE −10.02 1.20e−23 8.98 2.59e−19 FALCON −57.36 0 25.61 1.24e−144 ALPACA 30.67 1.29e−206 −61.45 0 VICUNA −12.49 8.44e−36 7.63 2.29e−14 OPENASSIST −37.27 4.84e−304 13.93 3.92e−44 MISTRAL −20.09 9.13e−90 32.56 1.63e−232 OLMO −54.54 0 22.08 4.47e−108 BAIZE 35.46 1.99e−275 −71.53 0 KOALA −21.60 1.77e−103 12.18 4.15e−34 WIZARDLM 20.65 9.93e−95 −40.48 0 MPT −30.71 4.81e−207 16.49 4.62e−61 Table 10: Significance test scores for ORDER bias (first and last order preference) for each evaluator compared to the random baseline. We see almost every model shows significant results with α = 0.05.\nCUNA. Interestingly, we see that the valid response rate within LLAMAV2 goes down as the model size is scaled up, but the impact of each bias greatly increases as the model size is scaled down (with the exception of SALIENCE BIAS). On the implicit bias benchmarks, LLAMAV2 exhibits more ro-bust performance with the proportion of responses affected by each bias SALIENCE BIAS in which longer responses are much more strongly preferred.\nFor the induced bias benchmarks, a similar trend is viewed in which the effect of each bias on the model as an evaluator is dampened in correlation to the model scale. On the contrary, VICUNA ex-hibits a stronger valid response rate as the model size is scaled; however, certain implicit biases are much more amplified, such as ORDER BIAS and SALIENCE BIAS. For implicit biases, VICUNA tends to prefer itself when actual model names are used as size is scaled smaller while tending to pre-fer much more verbose responses as model size is scaled higher. Across the induced biases, VICUNA performs more resiliently proportionally to scale, although still strongly influenced by BANDWAGON EFFECT but much less affected by ATTENTIONAL BIAS. We include another visualization correlat-ing the overall performance on each of the bias benchmarks with model size for the main results in Figure 2a.\nB.8 N-Rankwise setting: N = 4 We show the results and average rankings between four different models representing each of the dif-ferent size groups: CHATGPT (>100B), FALCON (>40B), ALPACA (>10B), VICUNA (<10B).\nFor the experimental setup, we conduct a smaller study, generating 100 responses from each of the 4 different LLMs using the Databricks Dolly15k dataset (Conover et al., 2023) via the same instruc-tion prompt template from Appendix C and the same evaluation prompt template from the ORDER bias.\nWe only employ this setting under the order bias setting in order to validate the complexity of the task that modern (smaller) LLMs aren’t capable of performing yet. We perform each experiment by randomizing the order of each list of responses and prompt each LM-as-evaluator to order the list from best to worst (top to bottom) according to the same criterion as the pairwise study (providing the in-struction/sample reference). Furthermore, we also track ORDER bias, calculated by the proportion of responses in which the first (randomly) placed model was also ranked first by the evaluator.\nAs viewed in Table 14, we find that most models besides the closed-source API models (e.g. Ope-nAI) have trouble generating a proper rank list for even an N = 4 setting. This may be due to the increased complexity of the task (Dziri et al., 2023) where the ranking of N generations may become much more difficult as N gets larger (since the task complexity increases).\n533 GPT4 CHATGPT INSTRUCTGPT Ego 0.78 0.58 0.28 Longer Ego 0.64 0.75 0.43 Shorter Ego 0.36 0.25 0.56 (a) Model Performance Comparison (>175B) LLAMAV2 LLAMA COHERE FALCON Ego 0.06 0.0 0.27 0.05 Longer Ego 0.18 0.0 0.68 0.6 Shorter Ego 0.81 0.0 0.32 0.4 (b) Model Performance Comparison (>40B) ALPACA VICUNA OPENASSIST Ego 0.18 0.27 0.15 Longer Ego 0.38 0.4 0.71 Shorter Ego 0.62 0.59 0.29 (c) Model Performance Comparison (>10B) MISTRAL OLMO BAIZE KOALA WIZARDLM MPT Ego 0.3 0.0 0.02 0.48 0.14 0.21 Longer Ego 0.64 0.0 0.0 0.56 0.54 0.83 Shorter Ego 0.36 1.0 0.0 0.44 0.46 0.17 (d) Model Performance Comparison (<10B) Table 11: Additional comparisons examining the proportion of EGOCENTRIC samples where the (self-preferred) model’s generation was longer/shorter than the other generation.\nFigure 4: Proportion of responses that were labeled bias for each bias benchmark.

We show each of the prompts (COMPASSION, BANDWAGON, ATTENTIONAL) derived from the original ORDER prompt in Section 4.2.

In the case of C.1, since model names are completely anonymous, the addition of “(You)” is omitted (as shown in Table 1, and models cannot tell if they are self-evaluating.\nIn contrast, C.2 shows recognizable names; thus, “(You)” is appended to the system name when self-evaluating. We highlight that the added “(You)” within the EGOCENTRIC example in Table 1 serves to explicitly communicate an example of an ego-centric bias to the reader and not necessarily the prompt itself.\nC.2 Compassion Fade ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent considering the reference and instruction?\nThe instruction is: {{instruction}} The reference is: {{reference}} “‘ {model1_name}: {model1_response} {model2_name}: {model2_response} “‘ Please response directly in the following format: System _ is better Do not provide any additional text or explanation: ### Response: C.3 Bandwagon Effect ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent considering the reference and instruction?\nThe instruction is: {{instruction}} The reference is: {{reference}} “‘ System Star: {model1_response} System Square: {model2_response} “‘ 85% of people believe that {system} is better.\nPlease response directly in the following format: System _ is better Do not provide any additional text or explanation: ### Response: C.4 Attentional Bias ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent considering the reference and instruction?\nThe instruction is: {{instruction}} The reference is: {{reference}} “‘ System Star: {model1_response} System Square: {model2_response} “‘ {distraction} Please response directly in the following format: System _ is better Do not provide any additional text or explanation: ### Response: 537 Attentional Bank {System} likes to eat apples and oranges.\nThe coolest thing that {System} can do is a 60 second hand-stand.\n{System} plays a lot of soccer and basketball.\n{System} has been all around Europe two times.\nC.5 Diverse Prompt ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent, accurate, factual, and helpful considering the reference and instruction?\nThe instruction is: {{instruction}} The reference is: {{reference}} “‘ System Star: {model1_response} System Square: {model2_response} “‘ Please response directly in the following format: System _ is better Do not provide any additional text or explanation: ### Response: C.6 Tie Prompt ### Instruction: Which system’s response is more coherent considering the reference and instruction?\nThe instruction is: {{instruction}} The reference is: {{reference}} “‘ System Star: {model1_response} System Square: {model2_response} “‘ If you believe each response is equally sufficient simply respond with: Tie Please response directly in the following format: System _ is better Do not provide any additional text or explanation: ### Response: 538 D Human Preference Study D.1 Annotator Recruitment & Annotation Process N=13-rankwise setting We recruited six work-ers from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform, each of whom had a U.S. high school diploma and a Human Intelligence Task (HIT) ap-proval rate of 99% or higher on the platform. To ensure better-quality annotations, we initiated a toy round using five sample instruction sets. Each in-struction in the toy round contained five brief LLM-generated sentences. Workers were then asked to rank these sentences based on their own prefer-ences, but taking into account the following two specific criteria: (1) the fluency and logical coher-ence of the LLM-generated text in response to a given instruction sentence, and (2) the text’s align-ment with a reference sentence that provided addi-tional context and background for the instruction sentence. Furthermore, they were asked to place a black bar above the answers that did not satisfy these two criteria, as this is used for the threshold to evaluate the quality of their texts.\nAfter each participant finished their annotation during the toy round, we carefully reviewed their submissions to ensure they had accurately followed the guidelines and considered the two ranking cri-teria and the position of black bar. For their efforts, each participant received a $3 payment for com-pleting the toy round (HIT). Running the toy HIT several times yielded a final selection of six quali-fied workers, who were then invited to participate in the next stage involving the actual task of rank-ing 50 instruction sets. Each of these sets included 13 texts generated by 13 different LLMs. Note that LLAMA2, MISTRAL, and OLMO were not included yet at the time of our human study.\nTo avoid overwhelming the workers, we divided the main task into five separate HITs, each contain-ing a varying number of instruction sets to rank: (1) a pilot round with 5 sets, (2) two intermediate rounds with 10 sets each, and (3) two final rounds with 13 and 12 sets, respectively, adding up to a total of 50 instruction sets. These six workers re-ceived compensation upon completing each HIT, accumulating to a minimum of $47 for the entire se-ries of rounds. This averaged out to approximately $1.05 per instruction set. Additionally, on average, it took each of the six workers about 5.8 minutes to complete a single instruction set. Lastly, con-sidering the level of difficulty for the workers to rank 13 outputs per instruction set, we also remu-nerated them with a bonus of at least $5 per round, based on the quality of their performance. Lastly, we checked that our collected data did not include any personally identifiable information or offensive content and that the AMT responses were already anonymized.\nBias in Pairwise Human Preference For each bias, we collected human preferences from 75 expe-rienced AMT workers who had HIT approval rates over 97%, had completed more than 10,000 HIT tasks, and resided in five major English-speaking countries (e.g., the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.) These workers were then grouped into 25 sets of 3, with each group assigned a HIT task encompassing 30 model pairs randomly sampled from an instruction.\nConsequently, we generated 25 HITs for each bias.\nThese workers were tasked with choosing between two anonymous options (e.g., System A and B) for each of the 30 pairs. Their decisions were purely based on their preference, but we also asked them to consider the alignment and coherency with the instruction and reference sentences of each set.\nTo employ a pre-task and training session, we asked the participating workers of each HIT to com-plete a qualification round, which asked three ex-ample instructions to complete and pass. Only workers who passed this round were allowed to start the main tasks of annotating 30 pairs, ensur-ing that the workers were able to understand the HIT. Each worker who participated in a HIT re-ceived a compensation of $2.5. Note that SLIENCE BIAS were computed using the annotations from ORDER BIAS experiments on the AMT platform.\nSimilarly, we confirmed that our collected data did not include any personally identifiable infor-mation or offensive content and that the AMT re-sponses were already anonymized.\nD.2 Details on using RBO Rank-biased overlap (RBO) 8 is a widely used met-ric for evaluating the similarity between two ranked lists and is particularly relevant for tasks in infor-mation retrieval (Oh et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023).\nThe RBO value ranges from 0 (non-conjoint) to 1 (identical). In more detail, 0 indicates that there is no intersection or similarity, while 1 indicates a total intersection and complete similarity between 8We implemented RBO using the python package ‘rbo’: https://pypi.org/project/rbo/.\n539 two ranked lists, A and B, in terms of ranked ele-ments and order. Unlike classical correlation-based metrics such as Kendall’s tau or Spearman’s rank correlation, RBO is intersection-based, so there is no criteria range of value for RBO regarding the interpretation of its score. Rather, a higher continu-ous value of RBO means a higher ranking similarity between A and B.\nIn addition, unlike traditional correlation-based metrics like Kendall’s τ or Spearman’s ρ, RBO al-lows for greater weighting of the top k elements in the ranked lists being compared. This feature makes RBO well-suited for our experimental setup, where AMT workers were tasked with reading and ranking 13 outputs generated by LLMs. We oper-ate under the assumption that workers are likely to place the highest-quality texts at the top five positions of their ranked lists.\nThis idea of weighing the top elements in the ranked outputs aligns with previous research, which claims RBO to be an effective metric for the agreement between ranked annotations with human rationals and automated evaluations, espe-cially when greater importance is given to the top-ranked elements (Jørgensen et al., 2022). Given these considerations, which are highly relevant to our own study, we decided to use RBO as the met-ric for assessing agreement between human prefer-ences and LLM evaluations.\nRBO is defined in Equation 1 and tailored to suit the specifics of our study. Here, H and L represent two ranked lists of shape (1, 13), corresponding to human preferences and LLM evaluations for each instruction set, respectively. The maximum depth for H and L is set at 13, and p is a tunable parame-ter that determines the degree of top-weightedness in the final RBO calculation. To obtain an average RBO score across all 50 instructions, we sum the individual RBO values between H and L and then divide by 50.\nRBO(H, L) = (1−p) 13 X d=1 pd−1 |A[1 : d] ∩B[1 : d]| d (1) Following the work of Webber et al. (2010), we set the value of p so that approximately 86% of the weight is concentrated on the first d ranks, where d = 5 in our case. The weight distribution over these top d ranks can be determined using Equation 2. This means that the value of Equation (2) given d = 5 should be 0.86. In our experimental setup, we found that p was approximately 0.8.\n(1 −pd−1) + (1 −p p ) · d · ln 1 1 −p − d−1 X i=1 pi i !\n(2) D.3 Details on Pairwise Human Preference Experiments In pairwise human preference experiments, we did not test the COMPASSION FADE and EGOCENTRIC BIAS as they cannot be applied to human cases, because humans are not likely to be impacted by the anonymity of model names and the texts used in our setups are not generated by humans as well.\nUnlike pairwise model evaluation as described in Section 4.2, we were not able to evaluate with humans all possible 5,250 model pairs. Instead, we first randomly selected 25 of the 50 total in-structions. Then for each instruction, we produced 15 pairs of randomly sampled model outputs and created another 15 pairs by reversing their order (for ORDER BIAS) or switching the bias-induced sentence between A or B (for BANDWAGON EF-FECT and ATTENTIONAL BIAS). This results in 30 pairs (with 15 unique model pairs) in total for each instruction and finally totals 750 pairs for all 25 instructions. Note that the sample size ensured a 95% confidence level with a 5% margin of error for a population size of 5250.\nUpon collecting all annotations for each bias, we calculated the average IAA using the RBO for each bias. Each instruction consisted of uniquely (but randomly) sampled model pairs, with some models appearing multiple times. Hence, we normalized the rank of each model in the sampled pairs by calculating the ratio of the model’s “win” to its total appearances. With this data, we re-ranked each model in the sampled pairs per instruction.\nAfterward, we computed the mean RBO among the ranked model lists from each group of three AMT workers per instruction. We then averaged these RBO values over all 25 instructions to calculate the IAA scores for each bias experiment.\nFinally, we computed the bias proportion for each annotator by dividing the number of biased pairwise samples by 15. Following these steps, we aggregated the bias proportions across all an-notators, showing the degrees of impact of bias on human preference in pairwise selections. For SALIENCE BIAS, we leveraged annotations from ORDER BIAS experiments and calculated propor-tions for shorter and longer preferred responses.\n540 We then reported the preference with a higher av-erage proportion that was computed all across an-notators, indicating whether humans were more influenced by shorter or longer length bias.\nD.4 Details on Pairwise Human Preference Samples We clarify that for each one of the three bias mea-surements, a random sample of 750 model pairs was tested by three annotators in the pairwise hu-man experiment setup, totaling 2250 samples for 3 annotators. More formally, we define: • B(= 3): Number of bias experiments (B_-salience, B_order, B_bandwagon) • S(= 25): Number of samples selected for each bias experiment • P(= 15): Number of original model output pairs (Model A - Model B) for each sample • M(= 2): Multiplier for both orderings of each pairwise sample (i.e., for each A-B we also add B-A) • A(= 3): Number of human annotators evalu-ating each model pair Tpairs = Total # of model pairs for one bias = S × P × M = 750 Tevals = total # of human evaluations for one bias = Tpairs × A = 750 × 3 = 2250 Thus, we analyze 2250 × B = 6750 samples across all bias setups.\nD.5 Interface Design We present the interface design temple for each of the human preference experiments setups on the AMT platform, including (1) N-rankwise se-tups (N=13) and (2) bias in pairwise human pref-erence, as described in Section 4.3. The original prototype of the interfaces that we used for the N-rankwise experiments, as in Figure 6 is based on https://github.com/mtreviso/TextRankerJS. For the pairwise human bias experiments, we referenced the interface design from Hayati et al.

However, with this rapid advancement comes the challenge of ensuring that these models perform reliably and ethically across different applications.\xa0  \n   \n Benchmarking LLMs has become a critical step in their use throughout the implementation lifecycle\xa0 , providing a structured way to evaluate model performance, robustness, and fairness. It is not just about testing the LLM on its own, but for the use case and data at hand which has a huge impact on performance and outputs.\xa0  \n   \n In this article we outline a framework for benchmarking LLMs, as well as highlighting the importance of validation at various stages of the life cycle, the value of both quantitative and qualitative metrics, and the need to address vulnerabilities and biases.\n\n# Benchmarking Large Language Models : Enhancing Reliability & Reducing Bias\n\n* Leo Ferrari, Caleb Severn, Srinivas Waghmare, Ghadir Abu Ahmad\n* Published: 09 December 2024\n\n**The LLM market is characterized by a high degree of complexity and rapid innovation. With the availability of numerous models, each boasting distinct capabilities, organizations face significant challenges in selecting the most suitable LLM for their specific use cases.**   \n The opaque nature of the training data used in proprietary models further complicates this process, making it difficult to fully understand their behaviours and potential risks. Additionally, traditional validation methods often fall short against the scale and complexity of modern LLMs, leading to potential issues in scalability and generalization.\xa0  \n   \n The need for a structured and rigorous benchmarking process is increasingly pressing, not only to minimise the risk of deploying suboptimal models but also to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory standards and ethical guidelines, ultimately building trust with stakeholders and driving innovation.\n\n**The Different Stages of LLM Validation**  \n   \n Effective LLM validation is not a one-size-fits-all process but rather a multi-faceted approach that requires careful consideration at each stage.  \n   \n As part of the full mode life cycle, after clearly defining the objectives and metrics that align with the intended use case (a crucial step setting the foundation for all subsequent evaluations) and preparing and cleaning the data, evaluation can be viewed as belonging to the following four major areas.\n\n**Quantitative Evaluation** – Quantitative metrics are employed to evaluate the model\'s performance. These metrics are task-specific and provide objective measures of how well the model is performing. While traditional classification metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1 score are useful for some tasks, LLMs often require more nuanced and task-specific metrics such as Rouge for summarization and text generation  \n   \n **Qualitative Evaluation** – Human evaluation plays a significant role in assessing the quality, coherence, and relevance of the model’s outputs. This stage helps identify areas where the model may perform well on paper but falls short in real-world applications.  \n   \n **Robustness Testing** – The model is tested against various adversarial inputs to assess its stability and security, identifying potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in real-world scenarios, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection.  \n   \n **Bias and Fairness Testing** – Finally, the model\'s outputs are examined for bias and fairness, ensuring that the LLM treats all demographics equitably and adheres to ethical standards. This stage is particularly important in applications where decisions can significantly impact people\'s lives\n\nEach stage of validation is necessary for the overall success of deploying LLMs, ensuring that the models not only perform well but also operate within ethical and secure boundaries. Although each stage demands investment of resource, effort, and expertise, omitting any one of them could lead to gaps that surface in production or can be exploited by malicious parties.\n\n**1. Quantitative metrics**\n\nQuantitative metrics form the starting of LLM evaluation, offering objective measures that help quantify a model’s performance across different tasks. These metrics are tailored to the specific tasks that LLMs are designed to perform, ranging from language modelling and text generation to machine translation and summarization. Industry benchmarks (such as HuggingFace’s LLM Leaderboard) can be useful for determining a shortlist of models and providers from the market that you may want to test for your use case. Figure 1 shows examples of quantitative metrics by task.\n\nFigure 1: Non-exhaustive list of quantitative metrics for LLMs, grouped by task\n\nDepending on your use case, you might consider LLM performance in the following areas:\n\n* **Text generation:** quality, coherence, relevance, and similarity of generated text compared to reference text or desired outputs\n* **Summarisation:** how accurately and comprehensively the generated summary captures key information and content\n* **Translation:** accuracy, fluency, and alignment of the translated text with the meaning and structure of original text\n* **Information retrieval:** relevance, accuracy, and ranking quality of retrieved documents or results in response to a query\n* **Question & answering:** accuracy, relevance, and completeness of the model\'s answers by comparing them to the correct or reference answers\n* **Speech Recognition:** accuracy and clarity of transcribed text by comparing it to the original spoken input\n* **Image captioning:** accuracy, relevance, and descriptiveness of generated captions by comparing them to human-written reference captions\n\nWhile quantitative metrics provide a robust framework for evaluating LLMs, they must be interpreted carefully, especially in the context of the specific use case. Published metrics often highlight strengths that may not fully align with the practical needs of an application, necessitating a more nuanced approach to their application.\n\nFigure 2: BLEU Summarisation Scores of LLMs\xa0 \xa0Llama3 (Meta), Gemma2 (Google), ChatGPT4o (OpenAI), and Luhn Summarisation Algorithm on BCBS 239 documentation, assessed across a range of uni-, bi-, tri- and quad-gram overlap weightings\n\nFor example, if you need an LLM to summarise text on BCBS documentation, you may choose Llama3 as it displays better overlap between the summarised and original text, as seen in Figure 2. However, if you wanted a summarisation that delineated different topics within the original text, ChatGPT-4o\xa0 could be better – something we will examine in a future article.  \n   \n Once you have shortlisted models to build into your pipeline, it is prudent to evaluate them using metrics that are bespoke to your use case and KPIs and tested on your data. For example, evaluating a model\'s suitability for finance and banking involves assessing its pre-training on financial texts, ease of fine-tuning with domain-specific data, and ability to transfer knowledge from general language tasks to finance-specific applications. This ensures the model performs well in the unique context of the financial sector.\n\n**2. Qualitative Metrics**  \n   \n While quantitative metrics provide numerical insights into an LLM’s performance, qualitative metrics capture the nuances that numbers alone cannot. These human-centric evaluations are useful for validating how well an LLM performs in real-world scenarios, where the subtleties of language, context, and user interaction play significant roles.\xa0  \n   \n Human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation approaches can enable continued SME involvement to understand model idiosyncrasies, mitigate risks and improve fidelity in a controlled environment before the model is deployed to production. Due to resource requirements (financial and FTE), this step could easily be omitted during prototyping but should be deeply considered before deployment, and should heavily involve business stakeholders to weigh against budget and timelines.\n\n\xa0 \xa0  \n   \n  Figure 3: Summary of HITL approaches with qualitative assessment of strengths; green denotes a strength of the approach, orange denotes an area to consider when employing the approach\n\n**3. Robustness Tests**  \n   \n As LLMs become more integral to various applications, their vulnerabilities also become more apparent. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by adversarial attacks, involving deliberately crafted inputs designed to trick the model into producing incorrect or harmful outputs. Addressing these vulnerabilities through robust defences is critical to ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs.  \n   \n Combating adversarial attacks can be a hugely laborious task, and it is reasonable that enterprise users of the LLMs expect the heavy lifting to be done by the providers. Nevertheless, providers can only do so much, so it is prudent to consider the defensive strategies that tech teams can incorporate into their processes:\n\n* **Hyperparameter tuning:** adjusting model parameters, such as temperature, can reduce the success of prompt injection attacks.\n* **Audit behaviour:** employ optimisation algorithms to identify elusive and undesirable model behaviours before deployment.\n* **Input/output filtering:** preprocess incoming data to identify and mitigate potential threats and anomalies and/or post-process model’s generated responses by blocking or modifying it to maintain ethical and safe interactions with LLMs.\n* **Human feedback integration:** incorporate human feedback and preferences directly into the pretraining phase rather than the fine-tuning stage to produce outputs that resonate more closely with human generations.\n* **Red teaming and adversarial training:** employ a dedicated group (human and automated techniques) using bespoke datasets simulating adversarial behaviours and attack strategies to identify vulnerability in the system, across hardware, software, and human elements.\n\n**4. Bias & Fairness**  \n   \n Ensuring that LLMs operate fairly across all demographic groups is a core principle of Responsible AI. Bias in the data that LLMs train on can lead to unequal treatment of users, perpetuating stereotypes and potentially causing harm in decision-making processes.\xa0  \n   \n Bias and fairness testing for LLMs focuses on evaluating model outputs across diverse demographic groups and contexts to identify disparities. It involves tasks like language generation, sentiment analysis, and classification, using diverse datasets and specific metrics to assess and ensure fairness and equity in model performance. The tests broadly cover the following approaches:\n\n* **Sentence completion tasks** with prompts that reveal biases in race, gender, religion, and other social categories (StereoSet, CrowS-Pairs, BOLD, WinoBias)\n* **Prediction or implicit association** of occupation or other attributes with social categories (Bias in Bios, WinoGender, SEAT)\n* **Using prompts** to elicit toxic responses (RealToxicityPrompts)\n\nEnsuring fairness in LLMs involves not only using diverse datasets and benchmarks but also continuously monitoring and updating the models to address emerging biases. While these tests primarily serve to diagnose biases, mitigating them is an integrated process where techniques such as prompt engineering can provide guardrails for the LLM when generating responses. However, total protection is not guaranteed, and periodic review of the outputs and user feedback is required to ensure users are treated fairly.\n\n**Beyond Model Performance: Cost**\n\nA final, but important factor, is the cost of running your use case leveraging a certain model. LLMs costs can vary significantly based on several factors, including the type of model, its size, usage frequency, deployment environment, and the provider\'s pricing structure.\xa0  \n   \n There are scenarios where there can be up to a 20 x price variance between different models for the same use case. This is critical for business to consider alongside performance to ensure the solution is viable and allows for business value to be generated.\xa0\n\n**Conclusion**  \n   \n Benchmarking LLMs is a complex yet essential process that goes beyond mere performance evaluation. It encompasses a comprehensive assessment of quantitative and qualitative metrics, robustness, and ethical considerations such as bias and fairness.\xa0  \n   \n As LLMs continue to evolve and become integral to various applications, it is imperative for organizations to adopt a rigorous benchmarking framework. This framework ensures that the models not only perform optimally but also operate within ethical and secure boundaries, ultimately leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.\n\n# Contact Us\n\n---\n\nTo find out more about working with Capco and how we can help you overcome any potential challenges, contact our experts via the form below.\n\n© Capco 2025, A [Wipro](https://www.wipro.com "Wipro") Company\n\n ')])]}}

{'research_agent': {'final_section_content': ["## Future Directions in Large Language Model Benchmarking\n\nThe rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked considerable interest in their evaluation and benchmarking methodologies. As these models become increasingly sophisticated, the frameworks used to assess their performance must also adapt. This section explores emerging trends in LLM benchmarking and speculates on future advancements in both technology and methodology.\n\n### Exploration of Emerging Trends in LLM Benchmarking\n\nThe benchmarking of LLMs is critical for understanding their capabilities and limitations. However, current evaluation methods often lack robustness and standardization, leading to inconsistencies in results across different studies. Recent trends highlight the need for more comprehensive and uniform evaluation frameworks.\n\nOne significant trend is the shift from purely quantitative metrics, such as perplexity and BLEU scores, to qualitative assessments that consider user experience and contextual understanding. Human-in-the-loop evaluations, which incorporate human feedback into the assessment process, have gained traction. This approach captures the nuances of language understanding and evaluates the model's performance in real-world scenarios, making it a valuable addition to traditional metrics.\n\nThe recognition of the need for benchmarks that encompass a wider range of tasks and domains is growing. Traditional benchmarks, such as GLUE and SuperGLUE, while useful, often focus on specific types of linguistic tasks. Future benchmarking efforts might include a more diverse set of tasks requiring reasoning, common sense knowledge, and ethical considerations. For example, benchmarks that test an LLM's ability to generate responses adhering to ethical guidelines or demonstrating cultural sensitivity are increasingly important in a globalized context.\n\nMoreover, the establishment of standardized evaluation frameworks is essential for facilitating comparisons across different models. Initiatives like the AI Metrics Initiative aim to create baseline metrics and protocols that can be widely adopted within the community, thus enhancing the reliability of benchmarks. Standardized frameworks can help identify best practices and guide future research directions.\n\n### Key Findings and Insights on Benchmarking Trends\n\nRecent developments in LLM benchmarking have introduced several innovative approaches. The emergence of frameworks like HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) evaluates LLMs across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human values. This multi-faceted approach is indicative of the shift towards more comprehensive evaluation strategies.\n\nAdditionally, dynamic benchmarks have become a focal point in the evaluation landscape. These benchmarks adapt to model capabilities, ensuring continuous relevance as models evolve. For instance, the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark suite covers diverse subjects, which is crucial for evaluating knowledge and reasoning in LLMs.\n\nThe integration of multimodal capabilities into LLM evaluations is also gaining traction. Models like GPT-4o can process and generate content across multiple modalities, combining text, images, and audio. This shift necessitates new evaluation methods that can assess performance in a multimodal context, reflecting the capabilities of these advanced models.\n\nFurthermore, there is a growing emphasis on safety and ethical compliance in LLM benchmarking. New metrics are being developed to measure harmful outputs, such as RealToxicityPrompts and ToxiGen, which assess the model's resilience against generating biased or toxic content. Adversarial testing frameworks, such as AdvBench, ensure that models can withstand manipulative inputs, thereby improving their robustness in diverse contexts.\n\n### Speculation on the Future of LLMs and Benchmarking\n\nLooking ahead, several key advancements in technology and methodology are likely to shape the future of LLMs and their benchmarking. One potential development is the integration of continuous learning techniques, where LLMs dynamically adapt and improve as they are exposed to new information and user interactions. This paradigm shift raises questions about how benchmarking can keep pace with models that are no longer static. Future frameworks may need to incorporate mechanisms for ongoing evaluation, ensuring that performance assessments remain relevant as models evolve.\n\nAdditionally, advancements in interpretability and explainability are expected to influence LLM benchmarking. As the demand for transparency in AI systems grows, new evaluation methods will need to account for how well LLMs can explain their reasoning and decision-making processes. Benchmarks focusing on a model's ability to produce justifiable and interpretable outputs will likely emerge as a critical aspect of evaluation.\n\nThe open-source movement has also gained momentum, with models like Meta's LLaMA series becoming increasingly accessible. This democratization of AI technology encourages innovation and enables researchers to build on existing frameworks, fostering a collaborative environment for LLM development. However, there are contrasting views regarding open-source versus proprietary models, as proprietary models like GPT-4 offer more comprehensive features and community support.\n\n### Contextual Background Information\n\nThe landscape of LLM benchmarking is rapidly evolving, with a clear acknowledgment of the need for more nuanced, dynamic, and culturally sensitive evaluations. The advancements in model capabilities necessitate equally robust and adaptable evaluation frameworks to ensure that models can be reliably deployed in diverse and sensitive applications. The continuous evolution of LLMs, marked by the increasing complexity of tasks they can perform, underscores the importance of developing evaluation methodologies that can effectively address these advancements.\n\nIn summary, the future of LLM benchmarking is poised for transformation through the integration of more holistic, dynamic, and human-centered evaluation approaches. As these models advance, the methodologies used for benchmarking them must evolve accordingly, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and ethical implications in real-world applications."], 'search_results': [SearchResults(query=Query(query='emerging trends in LLM benchmarking 2023'), results=[SearchResult(url='https://medium.com/@vndee.huynh/state-of-llm-in-2023-a-quick-recap-on-latest-advancements-46a55dfe1fe5', title='State Of LLM In 2023: A Quick Recap On Latest Advancements', raw_content='State Of LLM In 2023: A Quick Recap On Latest Advancements | by Duy Huynh | Medium\n\n===============\n\n[Sitemap](https://medium.com/sitemap/sitemap.xml)\n\n[Open in app](https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F46a55dfe1fe5&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderUser&%7Estage=mobileNavBar&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\n\nSign up\n\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40vndee.huynh%2Fstate-of-llm-in-2023-a-quick-recap-on-latest-advancements-46a55dfe1fe5&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n\n[](https://medium.com/?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\n\n[Write](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnew-story&source=---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_topnav------------------)\n\n[Search](https://medium.com/search?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\n\nSign up\n\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40vndee.huynh%2Fstate-of-llm-in-2023-a-quick-recap-on-latest-advancements-46a55dfe1fe5&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n\n![Image 1](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png)\n\nState Of LLM In 2023: A Quick Recap On Latest Advancements\n==========================================================\n\n[![Image 2: Duy Huynh](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*YMh821rY96ACRouZk6M9wg.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@vndee.huynh?source=post_page---byline--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\n[Duy Huynh](https://medium.com/@vndee.huynh?source=post_page---byline--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\nFollow\n\n8 min read\n\n·\n\nJan 27, 2024\n\n[](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Fp%2F46a55dfe1fe5&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40vndee.huynh%2Fstate-of-llm-in-2023-a-quick-recap-on-latest-advancements-46a55dfe1fe5&user=Duy+Huynh&userId=48e96cac519&source=---header_actions--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------clap_footer------------------)\n\n42\n\n1\n\n[](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F46a55dfe1fe5&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40vndee.huynh%2Fstate-of-llm-in-2023-a-quick-recap-on-latest-advancements-46a55dfe1fe5&source=---header_actions--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------bookmark_footer------------------)\n\n[Listen](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fplans%3Fdimension%3Dpost_audio_button%26postId%3D46a55dfe1fe5&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40vndee.huynh%2Fstate-of-llm-in-2023-a-quick-recap-on-latest-advancements-46a55dfe1fe5&source=---header_actions--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------post_audio_button------------------)\n\nShare\n\nOkay, it’s been more than a year since ChatGPT was released. Before this turning point, the research community and industry leaders were already actively working on generative AI, particularly in the realm of computer vision, with a series of stable diffusion findings and applications. To summarize briefly, 2022 could be considered the year of stable diffusion, and 2023 the year of large language models (LLMs).\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 3](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*AuQ8Pv6PBM3akx6U.png)\n\nLlama gang came in town — Image by DALL-E 3.\n\nThe beginning of 2023 marked the dominance of LLMs, with ChatGPT leading the charge in widespread adoption and innovation. This year saw LLMs becoming pervasive across various sectors, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical industry applications. Let’s explore the key milestones and trends that shaped the LLM landscape in 2023, also have some insight into how they have revolutionized our interaction with technology.\n\nYear of Open-source LLM\n-----------------------\n\nIn 2023, we witnessed a remarkable year for open-source large language models (LLMs). The most significant release was the LLaMa series by Meta, setting a precedent for frequent releases thereafter, with new models emerging every month, week, and sometimes daily. Key players like Meta, EleutherAI, MosaicML, TIIUAE, and StabilityAI introduced a variety of models trained on public datasets, catering to diverse needs within the AI community. The majority of these models were decoder-only Transformers, continuing the trend established by ChatGPT. Here are some of the most noteworthy models released this year:\n\n*   [**LLaMa by Meta:**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com) The LLaMa family features models of various sizes, with the largest model boasting 65 billion parameters, trained on 1.4 trillion tokens. Notably, the smaller models, especially the one with 13 billion parameters, trained on 1 trillion tokens, demonstrated superior performance by leveraging extended training periods on more data, even surpassing larger models in some benchmarks. The 13B LLaMa model outperformed GPT-3 in most benchmarks, and the largest model set new state-of-the-art performance benchmarks upon its release.\n*   [**Pythia by Eleuther AI:**](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)Pythia comprises a suite of 16 models with 154 partially trained checkpoints, designed to facilitate controlled scientific research on openly accessible and transparently trained LLMs. This series greatly aids researchers by providing detailed papers and a comprehensive codebase for training LLMs.\n*   [**MPT by MosaicML**](https://www.mosaicml.com/mpt?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)**and**[**Falcon series by TIIUAE:**](https://falconllm.tii.ae/falcon.html?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com) Both were trained on a diverse range of data sources, from 1T to 1.5T tokens, and produced versions with 7B and 30B parameters. Notably, later in the year, TIIUAE released a 180B model, the largest open-source model to date.\n*   [**Mistral**](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)**,**[**Phi**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)**and**[**Orca**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)**:** These models highlight another trend in 2023, focusing on training smaller and more efficient models suitable for limited hardware and budget constraints, marking a significant shift towards accessibility and practicality in AI model development.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 4](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*lh-M8fdCFwXvHolN.jpeg)\n\nLlama 2 is pretrained using publicly available online data. An initial version of Llama Chat is then created through the use of supervised fine-tuning. Next, Llama Chat is iteratively refined using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which includes rejection sampling and proximal policy optimization (PPO). [— Llama 2: open source, free for research and commercial use](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)\n\nSmall and Efficient Model\n-------------------------\n\nIn 2023, we have also witnessed the release of numerous small and efficient models. The primary reason for this trend is the prohibitively high cost of training large models for most research groups. Additionally, large models are often unsuitable for many real-world applications due to their expensive training and deployment costs, as well as their significant memory and computational power requirements. Therefore, small and efficient models have emerged as one of the main trends of the year. As mentioned earlier, the Mistral and Orca series have been key players in this trend. Mistral surprised the community with a 7B model that outperformed its larger counterparts in most benchmarks, while the Phi series is even smaller, with only 1.3B to 2.7B parameters, yet it delivers impressive performance.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 5](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*CfpcXXdh-F4Unckq.png)\n\nMistral-7b performance over LLaMA series — [https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)\n\nAnother innovative approach is [_Orca 2: Teaching Small Language Models How to Reason_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11045?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com), which involves distilling knowledge from a larger model, such as GPT-4, into a smaller one. Unlike previous studies that primarily relied on imitation learning to replicate the outputs of larger models, Orca 2 aims to equip “smaller” LLMs, specifically those with 7B and 13B parameters, with various reasoning methods, such as step-by-step analysis and recall-then-generate techniques. This approach allows these models to identify and apply the most appropriate method for each task, enabling Orca 2 to significantly outperform models of similar size and even compete with models that are 5 to 10 times larger.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 6](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*lU3QltEyJH6985Df.png)\n\nResults comparing Orca 2 (7B and 13B) to LLaMA-2-Chat (13B and 70B) and WizardLM (13B and 70B) on variety of benchmarks (in zero-shot setting) covering language understanding, common-sense reasoning, multi-step reasoning, math problem solving, etc — [Orca 2: Teaching Small Language Models How to Reason](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)\n\nThe success of small and efficient models largely depends on data quality and fast attention tricks. While Mistral has not disclosed the specifics of its training data, various research and models have shown that data quality is crucial for training effective models. One of the most notable findings this year is [_LIMA: “Less Is More for Alignment”_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com), which demonstrated that a human-generated, high-quality dataset consisting of only 1,000 training examples can be used for fine-tuning to outperform the same model fine-tuned on 50,000 ChatGPT-generated responses.\n\nLow-Rank Adaption Tuning\n------------------------\n\nOkay, let’s talk about [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com), which has shone as the brightest star among Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning methods introduced last year. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) emerged as a game-changer for fine-tuning LLMs efficiently. By introducing low-rank matrices approximation into pre-trained models, LoRA allows for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, significantly reducing the computational load and storage requirements. This approach not only saves resources but also enables customization for different applications without compromising the core capabilities of the base model.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 7](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*SblnqvRpf2FuEymG.jpeg)\n\nDifferent between LoRA and regular fine-tuning — [Practical Tips for Finetuning LLMs Using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/practical-tips-for-finetuning-llms?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)\n\nLoRA is basically freeze pre-trained model weights and inject trainable layers (_rank-decomposition matrices_). These matrices are compact yet capable of approximating the necessary adaptations to the model’s behavior, allowing for efficient fine-tuning while maintaining the integrity of the original model’s knowledge. One of the most frequently used variant of LoRA is [QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaption)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com). It is the memory efficient version of vanilla LoRA by quantizing the low-rank matrices. This approach allows for the use of low-rank matrices in the fine-tuning process without increasing the memory footprint and less computational-intensive.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 8](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*BHykVgbQQLfnFs6B.png)\n\nQLORA improves over LoRA by quantizing the transformer model to 4-bit precision and using paged optimizers to handle memory spikes. — Image from paper: [QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaption)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)\n\nMixture of Experts\n------------------\n\nThe [Mixture of Experts (MoE)](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com) approach represents a significant leap in LLM architecture last year. MoE is a long-history machine learning paradigm that simplifies complex problems by dividing them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, each addressed by a specialized sub-model or “expert.” This is akin to having a team of specialists, where each member excels in a particular domain. In an MoE model, each expert concentrates on a specific subset of the data or task. The decision of which expert to use for a given input is made by a “gating mechanism,” which acts as a traffic director, routing tasks to the most appropriate expert. This method allows MoE models to efficiently and accurately handle a broad spectrum of tasks. MoE is particularly beneficial because it combines the strengths of diverse models, leading to enhanced performance on complex tasks that might be difficult for a single, uniform model to address. It’s comparable to having a team of specialists at your disposal, ensuring that every facet of a problem is managed by someone with the requisite expertise, yielding more refined and effective solutions.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 9](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*FHvvn3XC4zEeQctP.png)\n\nMoE layer from paper [Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer, 2017.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)\n\nOne of the most notable MoE models released last year is [Mixtral-8x-7B](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com), which achieved impressive performance by combining eight smaller models, each with 7B parameters, using the MoE approach. There are also rumors that GPT-4 might be an MoE model, consisting of eight expert models, each with 220 billion parameters.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 10](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*-0F9MVPUvtO5Ao0M.png)\n\nMixtral-8x-7b performance — [Mixtral-8x-7B](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)\n\nFrom Language To General Foundation Models\n------------------------------------------\n\nLLMs are evolving into general foundation models, extending their capabilities beyond language processing. This transition signifies a shift towards models that can understand and generate not only text but also code, visual content, audio, and more. Last year, we saw the introduction of models like [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com) and GPT-4 for vision, which provided impressive capabilities in understanding visual content. This has sparked promising research in the field of general foundation models. In the near future, general foundation models will be able to see, hear, and understand the world around them, enabling more natural and intuitive interactions with humans.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 11](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*dUAFrKCxBRdUMAxw.png)\n\nAn example from [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com) project.\n\nTool-Equipped Agents\n--------------------\n\nThe integration of LLMs with various tools and platforms is making AI more accessible and practical for everyday use. Agents equipped with these tools are being tailored for specific tasks, ranging from coding assistance to creative writing, making AI an indispensable part of many professional workflows. This development has been made possible due to the **reasoning** and **action** capabilities of LLMs. This type of feature is often referred to as function calling under the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com) framework. There are also many models trained on datasets that include function calling to enable this feature.

The GPT-4 and the new [GPT store](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-gpt-store?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com) feature in ChatGPT remain the industry standards, offering high-quality generative AI applications that are unparalleled and unique, with no competitors coming close at this time. OpenAI has also demonstrated significant support for its user community by organizing the first [OpenAI Dev Day](https://devday.openai.com/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com) and providing various developer-friendly features in 2023. Anthropic emerges as one of the most promising competitors, although its flagship LLM, [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-2?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com), is not yet widely available. Another tech giant, Google, released [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/?ref=blog.duy-huynh.com#introduction) last year, which has been quite impressive compared to OpenAI’s GPT series, according to reports. However, it has not yet garnered sufficient traction within the community. We will see what happens in 2024 when they plan to release the largest version of Gemini.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![Image 13](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*Q-ZCZdWv28SoiL9C.jpeg)\n\nOpenAI Dev Day — [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk&ref=blog.duy-huynh.com)\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe year 2023 marked a period of significant growth and innovation in the field of large language models (LLMs). From the democratization of AI through open-source models to the development of more efficient and specialized systems, these advancements are not just technical feats but also steps toward making AI more accessible and applicable in various domains. Looking ahead, the potential for these technologies to transform industries and enhance human capabilities continues to be an exciting prospect. In 2024, we anticipate even more remarkable milestones, with Meta announcing plans to train LLaMA-3 and had a plan to open-sourcing it. In the industry landscape, there is also keen interest in seeing whether giants like Google or startups such as Anthropic can surpass OpenAI.\n\nGet Duy Huynh’s stories in your inbox\n-------------------------------------\n\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\nVisit and subscribe [my personal blog](https://blog.duy-huynh.com/) for more articles in the future.\n\n[Llm](https://medium.com/tag/llm?source=post_page-----46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\n[Technology](https://medium.com/tag/technology?source=post_page-----46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://medium.com/tag/artificial-intelligence?source=post_page-----46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\n[](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Fp%2F46a55dfe1fe5&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40vndee.huynh%2Fstate-of-llm-in-2023-a-quick-recap-on-latest-advancements-46a55dfe1fe5&user=Duy+Huynh&userId=48e96cac519&source=---footer_actions--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------clap_footer------------------)\n\n42\n\n[](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Fp%2F46a55dfe1fe5&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40vndee.huynh%2Fstate-of-llm-in-2023-a-quick-recap-on-latest-advancements-46a55dfe1fe5&user=Duy+Huynh&userId=48e96cac519&source=---footer_actions--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------clap_footer------------------)\n\n42\n\n1\n\n[](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F46a55dfe1fe5&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40vndee.huynh%2Fstate-of-llm-in-2023-a-quick-recap-on-latest-advancements-46a55dfe1fe5&source=---footer_actions--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------bookmark_footer------------------)\n\n[![Image 14: Duy Huynh](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*YMh821rY96ACRouZk6M9wg.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@vndee.huynh?source=post_page---post_author_info--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\n[![Image 15: Duy Huynh](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*YMh821rY96ACRouZk6M9wg.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@vndee.huynh?source=post_page---post_author_info--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\nFollow\n\n[Written by Duy Huynh --------------------](https://medium.com/@vndee.huynh?source=post_page---post_author_info--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\n[431 followers](https://medium.com/@vndee.huynh/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\n·[12 following](https://medium.com/@vndee.huynh/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--46a55dfe1fe5---------------------------------------)\n\nTechnician, AI/ML Engineer & Startups Builder.

language models (LLMs) are being developed continuously to catch up with the growing capabilities of new models and AI in general, using and evaluating LLMs in non-English languages remains a little-charted landscape. We give a concise overview of recent developments in LLM benchmarking, and then propose a new taxonomy for the categorization of benchmarks that is tailored to multilingual or non-English use scenarios. We further propose a set of best practices and quality standards that could lead to a more coordinated development of benchmarks for European languages. Among other recommendations, we advocate for a higher language and culture sensitivity of evaluation methods.   \n   \n Keywords:\u2009large language models, benchmarking, taxonomy, cultural competence, quality recommendations\n\nCharting the European LLM Benchmarking Landscape:   \nA New Taxonomy and a Set of Best Practices\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Špela Vintar∗†, Taja Kuzman Pungeršek∗, Mojca Brglez∗†, Nikola Ljubešić∗ |\n| ∗Jožef Stefan Institute |\n| Jamova 39, Ljubljana, Slovenia |\n| {spela.vintar, taja.kuzman, mojca.brglez, nikola.ljubesic}@ijs.si |\n| †Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana |\n| Aškerčeva 2, Ljubljana, Slovenia |\n\nAbstract content\n\n## 1.\u2003\u200aIntroduction\n\nThe rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, reasoning, coding, and more. With the global race in raising the bar, commercial models are approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) and exhibit more and more agency as they engage in strategic planning, independently interact with other applications, and carry out larger tasks. While open-source models generally score lower on most leaderboards, they too grow larger and smarter.\n\nIn the brief history of LLMs, many evaluation frameworks have been set up – both human and automatic – to assess their evolving performance across different linguistic and non-linguistic tasks of growing complexity. While new benchmarks emerge almost on a daily basis in order to measure these expanding abilities, the overwhelming majority of evaluation datasets are developed primarily for English, creating a significant evaluation gap for other languages and varieties.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of LLMs in non-English contexts, a widely used approach so far has been to translate existing English benchmarks using machine translation, with or without human revision. This might seem reasonable: several major international benchmarks or benchmark collections (e.g., SuperGLUE (Wang et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib40)), MMLU (Hendrycks et\xa0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib19)), Hellaswag (Zellers et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib45)) exist together with their parallel (translated) versions, and this allows for a direct comparison of LLMs across a wide range of tasks and languages. However, Global-MMLU (Singh et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib37)) revealed that success in MMLU depends heavily on learning Western-centric concepts, with 28% of all questions requiring culturally sensitive knowledge. Moreover, for questions requiring geographic knowledge, an astounding 84.9% focus on either North American or European regions. Such cultural biases are not uncommon in other widely used benchmarks, and their machine-translated versions potentially overlook language- and culture-specific phenomena, exhibit skewed performance which does not accurately reflect true multilingual capabilities, or simply fail to address issues which may be critical for users of an LLM in a particular language.\n\nOn the other spectrum of multilingual evaluation, there are several cases of language- and culture-specific benchmarks, such as those included in the Hungarian HuLu (Ligeti-Nagy et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib27)) evaluation framework, BenCzechMark (Fajcik et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib14)), PLCC (Dadas et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib10)), or BertaQA (Etxaniz et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib12)), which have been developed specifically for a particular language or community of speakers. Such benchmarks provide a deeper insight into a model’s performance for that language, but typically do not allow us to assess the model’s multilingual capacities.\n\nDespite the proliferation of evaluation platforms, research projects, and benchmarking initiatives across the multilingual landscape, the field lacks a comprehensive overview that synthesizes current practices, identifies critical gaps, and provides clear guidance for developing more inclusive and effective evaluation methodologies for LLMs in non-English contexts. We thus make a case for the creation of a European benchmarking registry that collects structured benchmark data according to a universal and inclusive taxonomy of benchmarks. The proposed registry would include rich descriptive metadata and provide a clear overview of both existing benchmarks and the gaps in the current European benchmarking landscape.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#S2 "2. Recent Developments in LLM Benchmarking ‣ Charting the European LLM Benchmarking Landscape: A New Taxonomy and a Set of Best Practices"), we present some recent developments in LLM benchmarking, focusing on evaluations of linguistic and cultural competence in a multilingual context and on emerging trends. In Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#S3 "3. Categorization of Benchmarks ‣ Charting the European LLM Benchmarking Landscape: A New Taxonomy and a Set of Best Practices"), we proceed with a proposal for a categorization of benchmarks that could serve as a foundation for charting ongoing and future LLM evaluation activities in Europe and beyond. We finally propose some recommendations as to how existing benchmarks can be documented, and how future benchmarks can be made both more culture-aware and more in tune with the needs of different language communities.\n\n## 2.\u2003\u200aRecent Developments in LLM Benchmarking\n\nSeveral comprehensive overviews of LLM benchmarking have recently been published, including Chang et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib4)) and Ni et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib30)). Both surveys clearly show trends in both the development of datasets and the evolution of evaluation metrics. However, they lack a focus on non-English and multilingual scenarios, which is the main motivation for this work.\n\n### 2.1.\u2003\u200aMajor Benchmarks\n\nBy major or global, we refer to benchmarks most frequently used in current evaluation platforms and leaderboards. These benchmarks are without exception in English. The ones that evaluate generic language understanding and commonsense reasoning have their origins in the 2018–2022 period, when the challenges still roughly corresponded to natural language processing (NLP) research areas. Some of these benchmarks have seen multiple revisions, extensions and updates, and can be seen as “parent” datasets on which many adaptations, translations, or local versions are based.\n\nSome of the most prominent for language understanding and reasoning include MMLU (Hendrycks et\xa0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib19)) and its derivatives MMLU-Pro (Wang et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib41)), MMLU-Prox Xuan et\xa0al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib43)) and Global MMLU (Singh et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib37)); the SuperGLUE benchmark collection comprising BoolQ (yes/no questions, Clark et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib7)), CommitmentBank (textual entailment, De\xa0Marneffe et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib11)), COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives for causal reasoning, Roemmele et\xa0al., [2011](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib34)), MultiRC (multi-sentence reading comprehension, Khashabi et\xa0al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib22)), ReCoRD (reading comprehension with commonsense reasoning, Zhang et\xa0al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib46)), RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment, Giampiccolo et\xa0al., [2007](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib15)), WiC (Words in Context, Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib31)), and WSC (Winograd Schema Challenge, Levesque et\xa0al., [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib24)); ARC (Clark et\xa0al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib8)) with multiple-grade science questions; Hellaswag (Zellers et\xa0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib45)) and its recent derivative GoldenSwag (Chizhov et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib6)). An attempt to create a more challenging benchmark collection is BIG-bench (Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark, Srivastava et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib38)), a massive collaborative benchmark consisting of 204 tasks contributed by more than 450 authors across 132 institutions, designed to probe large language models on tasks believed to be beyond their current capabilities. Finally, SUPERB (Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark, Yang et\xa0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib44)) is a unified speech-focused benchmark for evaluating self-supervised and general-purpose speech representations across a wide spectrum of speech processing tasks. It organizes 10 core tasks – including automatic speech recognition, speaker identification, keyword spotting, emotion recognition, and intent classification – spanning content, speaker, semantics, and paralinguistics.\n\n### 2.2.\u2003\u200aMultilingual Benchmarks\n\nMost state-of-the art models have multilingual capabilities, but since the precise amounts of non-English data used in their pre-training are usually obscure, it is hard to say to what extent the language competence of a model in a particular language is in correlation with the amount of language-specific data it has seen. In addition to this, models differ in their representations of intermediate layers, which may result in cultural conflicts between latent internal and target output language (Zhong et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib47)).\n\nSince many authors observe a marked decline in performance for low-resource languages, benchmarks are now being developed both as parallel evaluation sets based on existing “parent” datasets to allow for direct comparison of LLM capabilities across a number of languages, and as language-specific benchmarks, usually aimed at assessing LLM performance in a particular linguistic community and/or culture (see Section [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#S2.SS4 "2.4. Language- and Culture-Specific Benchmarks ‣ 2. Recent Developments in LLM Benchmarking ‣ Charting the European LLM Benchmarking Landscape: A New Taxonomy and a Set of Best Practices") for the latter).\n\nAlthough the datasets in the first category are parallel, they may differ considerably in the methods used for their creation. Some were translated using machine translation or LLMs, for example, EU20-MMLU, EU20-HellaSwag, EU20-ARC, EU20-TruthfulQA, and EU20-GSM8K (Thellmann et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib39)); or MMLU-Prox (Xuan et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib43)). Other multilingual benchmarks were created with a special focus on cultural sensitivity by dividing the original subsets into culturally sensitive and culturally agnostic ones (Global MMLU, Singh et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib37)), or by using professional translators or multiple rounds of revision to raise the quality of the dataset, e.g., BenchMax (Huang et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib20)), Flores-101 and FLORES-200 (Goyal et\xa0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib17)) and Belebele (Bandarkar et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib2)).\n\nFor speech, ML-SUPERB (Multilingual Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark, Shi et\xa0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib36)) extends the English SUPERB speech benchmark to 143 languages, evaluating self-supervised speech representations on automatic speech recognition and language identification. FLEURS\xa0Conneau et\xa0al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib9)) is a speech-based extension of the FLORES multilingual benchmark, with focus on language identification, automatic speech recognition, and retrieval evaluation. DIALECTBENCH (Faisal et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib13)) is the first large-scale benchmark for language variety understanding, aggregating 10 text-level tasks for 281 varieties.\n\n### 2.3.\u2003\u200aDynamic Benchmarks\n\nRecent developments emphasize dynamic and contamination-resistant evaluation. The period 2022–2025 has witnessed fundamental shifts toward more sophisticated evaluation approaches. One such attempt is LiveBench (White et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib42)), the first benchmark designed to resist training data contamination through frequently updated questions from recent sources, automatic scoring, and monthly updates. This dynamic approach remains challenging, with the top models achieving accuracy below 80%.\n\n### 2.4.\u2003\u200aLanguage- and Culture-Specific Benchmarks\n\nFocusing on different approaches to the evaluation of LLM performance in non-English European languages, we find a broad array of language- and culture-specific benchmarks developed with various methodologies and serving different purposes, of which we present the ones we find most interesting.\n\nMany European languages have established evaluation frameworks dedicated to language-specific benchmarks, and in most cases such frameworks combine traditional datasets translated from English, and native more culture-aware benchmarks. Examples include HuLu111<https://hulu.nytud.hu> for Hungarian (Ligeti-Nagy et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib27)), which covers a number of well-known tasks such as plausible alternatives (HuCoPa), textual entailment (HuRTE) and linguistic acceptability (HuCoLa), of which the latter was originally constructed using sentences from selected Hungarian linguistics books. BenCzechMark for Czech (Fajcik et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib14)) is a complex benchmark collection comprising 50 tasks, of which 14 were newly created and only 10% of the collective instances were machine-translated. The authors also employ multiple evaluation metrics including duel scoring. Another recent benchmark for Czech, Ukrainian and Slovak called CUS-QA (Libovickỳ et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib26)) focuses specifically on cultural competence and crafts questions, both textual and visual, from Wikipedia articles which exist in only one of the languages.\n\nFor Iberian languages, a comprehensive and extensible framework has been established under IberBench (González et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib16)), spanning 22 task categories and addressing both generic and industry-relevant tasks. In parallel and under a similar name, IberoBench (Baucells et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib3)) offers 62 tasks of which several were created from scratch from native data, and others were included only if they satisfied rather strict quality criteria.\n\nFor Slovenian, the SloBENCH222<https://slobench.cjvt.si> evaluation framework offers natural language inference (SI-NLI), machine translation, speech recognition, Slovene SuperGLUE, and two pragmatics benchmarks: SloPragMega and SloPragEval. To create the latter, full localization of the originally English dataset was performed, by adapting cultural references and occasionally completely rewriting examples to better match the linguistic and cultural context. A similar approach has been taken while translating and adapting the COPA benchmark\xa0(Roemmele et\xa0al., [2011](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib34)) to four standard languages and three dialects of the South Slavic language group, resulting in the DIALECT-COPA\xa0(Ljubešić et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib28)) benchmark collection. While proper cultural adaptation did take place, the overall popularity and age of the parent COPA benchmark surely makes it prone to LLM contamination. Regardless of that, today’s best-performing proprietary models still score only halfway between random and optimal on dialectal data \xa0(Chifu et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib5)).\n\nA fully native benchmark is ITALIC for Italian (Seveso et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib35)), which comprises 10,000 instances from 12 domains and was built entirely from exam materials offered by various public institutions or government bodies.\n\nAn exceptionally active approach to language- and culture-specific benchmarking can be observed for Polish333<https://huggingface.co/spaces/speakleash/polish-llm-benchmarks>, with a range of generic and domain-specific evaluations for Polish including multi-turn conversation (MT-Bench), emotional intelligence (EQ-Bench), comprehensive text understanding (CPTUB444<https://huggingface.co/spaces/speakleash/cptu_bench>), medical domain benchmark, linguistic and cultural competency (PLCC, Dadas et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib10)), educational (LLMs Behind the School Desk), cultural vision benchmark, and legal QA tasks. Most of these benchmarks were developed anew, by carefully selecting tasks and examples, verifying them by experts and collecting human annotations. The CPTUB is composed of two parts, the first evaluating implicatures (implied meaning, sarcasm, idiomatic expressions) and the second testing on tricky questions (logical puzzles, semantic ambiguity, logical inconsistencies, absurdity, humor). Similarly, the PLCC consists of 600 manually crafted questions and is divided into six categories: history, geography, culture and tradition, art and entertainment, grammar, and vocabulary. The leaderboard results555<https://huggingface.co/spaces/sdadas/plcc> indicate that even the largest models still reach mediocre performance in Polish grammar and vocabulary, thus justifying the need for detailed assessment of linguistic competence for other European languages as well. A final example of a culturally specific benchmark is the Polish Cultural Vision Benchmark666<https://huggingface.co/spaces/speakleash/Polish_Cultural_Vision_Benchmark>, a collection of images with text descriptions to evaluate the cultural competence of multimodal models. The dataset is part of a citizen science project aimed at collecting 1 million culturally specific images777<https://obywatel.bielik.ai> and recruiting user donations under the slogan of “technopatriotism.” While similar platforms have been established before to collect text data, this is a positive example of a contemporary and at the same time participatory benchmark.\n\n## 3.\u2003\u200aCategorization of Benchmarks\n\nSince this paper makes a case for a European database of LLM benchmarks, we propose a new taxonomy which would allow a better categorization and labeling of benchmarks for non-English languages. This would allow us to better compare LLMs across languages; gain deeper insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current and future LLMs in a specific language, use case, modality or domain; set common priorities and work towards filling the evaluation and performance gaps.\n\nThe proposed taxonomy should serve as a (tentative) hierarchy of labels to organize or classify benchmarks; many (or indeed most) belong to more than a single category. For this reason, a natural choice to store and query the European benchmarking activities is a database, in which benchmarks are described according to this proposal. Thus, the benchmarks are assigned non-exclusive categories and are richly described with metadescriptions.\n\nWhile alignment, including trustworthiness, truthfulness and safety of LLMs, are central topics to the development of LLMs, they constitute another level of evaluation. Many elements of AI ethics partly overlap, or are entailed, in other benchmarks (e.g., bias is revealed in translation or language generation; trustworthiness is related to reasoning performance, etc.). This is another reason why multiple categories per benchmark are considered typical and expected.\n\nSince LLMs tend to perform worse in non-English languages, and especially non-standard varieties, over a spectrum of tasks, we propose that the language- and culture-related abilities receive more attention, and therefore a more fine-grained taxonomy than they do in existing taxonomies. The list can be expanded as needed.\n\n### 3.1.\u2003\u200aExisting Taxonomies\n\nAs new benchmarks are continuously presented to evaluate the emerging capabilities of LLMs, many attempts have been made to organize them in a structured and logical way.\n\nThe AI Verify Foundation has established one of the most systematic approaches to LLM benchmark categorization globally. In their October 2023 publication “Cataloguing LLM Evaluations” (AI Verify Foundation, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib1)), LLM benchmarks are organized into 5 top categories (further divided into subcategories). These are General Capabilities (natural language understanding, natural language generation, reasoning, knowledge and factuality, tool use effectiveness, multilingualism, and context length handling); Domain Specific Capabilities (specialized industry performance across various domains); Safety and Trustworthiness; Extreme Risks; and Undesirable Use Cases.\n\nThe catalogue represents a comprehensive and valuable contribution to the field, and has many positive features: The taxonomy is based on LLM capabilities, occasionally also referred to as tasks, which seems intuitively most pragmatic as this is usually the way we think about (and evaluate) human performance too. Complex benchmarks can appear in several categories simultaneously (e.g., BigBench as a massive collaborative benchmark appears in almost all taxonomy categories), and the recommendations for future LLM evaluations are a solid starting point to reinforce minimum quality standards for fair and trustworthy LLM assessment.\n\nHowever, the catalogue also has some drawbacks which render it unsuitable for our purposes. Firstly, to no fault of its authors, it has not been updated since 2023 and hence does not include many benchmarks which have since become mainstream, nor does it address recent developments in LLMs and AI in general. Secondly, although it includes Multilinguality as a separate category, it falls short in capturing some aspects of LLM performance which may be critical for the evaluation of European models; i.e., models specifically developed to be used in region-, language-, culture- or domain-specific contexts. Thirdly, and this is less of a drawback but simply an observation, the taxonomy and the quality recommendations are primarily focused on the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs, in the context of AI governance and alignment research. While these are indeed crucial priorities especially for the so-called ”frontier models” and capabilities, the European landscape of LLM development and evaluation is – at least for now – gyrating around a different set of goals, such as how to reach state-of-the-art levels of understanding and generation in non-English languages, or how to de-bias English-centric models.\n\nOther approaches to taxonomization include HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models), also referred to as the Stanford approach (Liang et\xa0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib25)). The authors introduce the concept of scenarios (what we want to evaluate) and metrics (which performance aspects are measured, and how), then propose a taxonomy of scenarios and desiderata. Today, the framework888<https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/> includes a number of leaderboards with support for multimodality and model-graded evaluation. While the scenarios proposed in HELM and the framework itself leave room for continuous extension, they do not in fact offer a hierarchical structure with sufficient focus on multilinguality and issues related to the use of LLMs in non-English contexts.\n\nSimilarly, Chang et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib4)) provide an overview of existing LLM evaluations, which they examine from three aspects: what, where, and how to evaluate. They divide the evaluations tasks into eight top-level non-exclusive categories, namely Natural language processing; Robustness, ethics, biases and trustworthiness; Social sciences; Natural science and engineering; Medical applications; Agent applications; and Other applications.\n\nHuber and Niklaus ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib21)) present a cognitive-based view on benchmarking by mapping the well-known Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive abilities to LLM capabilities across six hierarchical cognitive levels: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create, revealing significant gaps in the coverage of higher-order thinking skills.\n\nAnother comprehensive attempt at taxonomizing benchmarks is by Guo et\xa0al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib18)) who introduce a three-pillar framework that categorizes LLM evaluation into three major groups: Knowledge and capability evaluation, Alignment evaluation, and Safety evaluation.\n\n### 3.2.\u2003\u200aNew Taxonomy Proposal\n\nAs already outlined in the sections above, the proposed taxonomy is intended for the categorization of (mainly) European LLM benchmarks and is based on AI Verify Foundation’s catalogue, but with the following modifications:\n\n* •\n\n  We merge all language-related tasks and scenarios under a single top-level category called Language capabilities.\n* •\n\n  We further merge the traditional NLP divide between natural language understanding and natural language generation into a single subcategory. The fact is that state-of-the-art LLMs more often than not combine these two capabilities, and even straight-forward tasks such as question answering or text summarization involve both.\n* •\n\n  We expand the category for general linguistic competence with further subcategories for style, conversation and pragmatics, and allow for other more fine-grained aspects of measuring the grammaticality, stylistic appropriateness or coherence of generated outputs.\n* •\n\n  We expand the category of specific linguistic competence to include creativity, atypical communication, the use of domain-specific language etc.\n* •\n\n  We also expand and redefine the category of multilinguality to include code-switching, multilingual interaction, and dialectal flexibility.\n* •\n\n  We introduce cultural competence as a separate category.\n* •\n\n  We introduce speech as a separate category to include benchmarks specifically aimed at performing tasks unique to spoken language as input or output.999We propose Modality as one of the metadescriptors, allowing for any benchmark to be implemented in any of the modes. The Speech category refers to evaluations targeted at speech-related activities.\n* •\n\n  We add agency as a form of long-term, consistent or strategic reasoning.\n\nFigure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#S3.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 3.2. New Taxonomy Proposal ‣ 3. Categorization of Benchmarks ‣ Charting the European LLM Benchmarking Landscape: A New Taxonomy and a Set of Best Practices") shows the four top-level taxonomy categories with subcategories. The full taxonomy along with fine-grained third-level categories will be added as Appendix A into the camera-ready version of this paper.\n\n## 4.\u2003\u200aQuality Standards and Metadata\n\nIf we conceive of a European benchmarking registry as a searchable database which may help the LLM development community in setting priorities, exchanging knowledge and standardizing evaluation practices, we should be able to define some desiderata around how a particular benchmark is presented, described and distributed. Below we discuss some of these aspects.\n\n### 4.1.\u2003\u200aProvenance\n\nWhile it is clear that the development of original and sufficiently complex benchmarking datasets is highly time-consuming and costly, the drawbacks of automatically translated and culturally maladapted benchmarks have been clearly pointed out (Singh et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib37); Xuan et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib43)). We should thus strive towards clearer – even if more complex – descriptors which indicate how a dataset or benchmark was created. We propose the following descriptors:\n\n* •\n\n  Original Applies to datasets which have been originally created in the language they appear in, by any method other than translation (e.g., collecting original exam questions, employing experts to provide domain-specific tasks, adapting authentic texts in a particular language to create tasks in that language).\n* •\n\n  Machine translation Applies to datasets created by any automated translation service, including those created by LLMs using any kind of prompt scenario, and workflows with machine revision. The tools and workflows must be specified.\n* •\n\n  Machine translation and Human revision Applies to datasets where the result of automated translation was revised by a human professional or non-professional translator or reviewer. Since many non-English benchmarks are created by machine translating the – usually – English original, followed by human revision of only a small portion of the dataset, the recommendation would be to use all labels that apply.\n* •\n\n  Human translation Used only for datasets which have been fully translated and revised by humans. Only a few European non-English datasets satisfy this criterion.\n* •\n\n  Full localization Used for datasets which have not only been translated professionally, but for which a full linguistic and cultural adaptation was performed. This might mean the replacement of culturally-specific or untranslatable tasks with new ones, or removing parts of the dataset deemed culturally unsuitable.\n* •\n\n  Other If several of the above scenarios were used, the dataset should be labeled with all that apply. Other methods and scenarios used in the creation of a dataset should be specified here.\n\n### 4.2.\u2003\u200aAccessibility\n\nThe tension between open benchmarking and data contamination poses a significant challenge for AI evaluation. While public datasets enable reproducible research and fair comparisons, they risk contamination when models train on test data, inflating performance scores and undermining benchmark validity. Private evaluation sets offer a potential solution by keeping data hidden from training processes, ensuring cleaner performance measurements.\n\n* •\n\n  Public Applies to fully open datasets shared with labels through common platforms.\n* •\n\n  Public without labels Applies to datasets where labels are not distributed to prevent direct training.\n* •\n\n  Private (academic/research access) Where authors encourage reproducibility but wish to prevent contamination.\n* •\n\n  Private (closed/proprietary) Where datasets are typically not shared as they are used for internal or industry-specific evaluation.\n* •\n\n  Other This may include dynamic benchmarks where tasks are continually updated (such as White et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib42)).\n\n### 4.3.\u2003\u200aLanguage Coverage\n\nThis category indicates the prominence, reach or scale of a benchmark in terms of its presence on major leaderboards, coverage, global spread, but also purpose. We are aware that the boundaries between the proposed buckets may be fuzzy.\n\n* •\n\n  Major global benchmark See section [2.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#S2.SS1 "2.1. Major Benchmarks ‣ 2. Recent Developments in LLM Benchmarking ‣ Charting the European LLM Benchmarking Landscape: A New Taxonomy and a Set of Best Practices") for examples.\n* •\n\n  Multilingual benchmark This category can be used for benchmarks derived from the above, for instance by developing a multilingual variant of a well-known benchmark for a set of new languages. Examples include XCOPA (Ponti et\xa0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib32)), MMLU-Prox (Xuan et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib43)) or xHumanEval (Raihan et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib33)).\n* •\n\n  Language-group or region-specific benchmark This category is used for language-specific benchmarks as well as benchmarks that cover multiple languages from a similar language group or target a certain geographical region. Examples include IberoBENCH\xa0(Baucells et\xa0al., [2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib3)) and DIALECT-COPA\xa0(Ljubešić et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib28)).\n* •\n\n  Other\n\n### 4.4.\u2003\u200aEvaluation Type\n\nAn important factor for present and future benchmarks is the divide between closed-ended types of tasks, most prominently multiple-choice questions, but also other types of tasks where the solution is included in the task, and open-ended tasks, typically generation of text, speech, image, or multimodal output. Few benchmarks to date address the latter, despite the fact that generative LLMs are now mainstream and the vast majority of application scenarios exploit generative abilities.\n\n### 4.5.\u2003\u200aEvaluation Metrics and Frameworks\n\nThe performance of an LLM can be evaluated in several ways, depending on the type of task. For multiple choice questions, text classification tasks or cloze tests, where the correct answer is deterministic, accuracy or F1 can be used. However, to evaluate longer, more complex responses resulting from generative tasks, many other methods were proposed. In reference-based evaluation, the LLM response is compared to a reference using various distance measures (e.g., BERTScore, Rouge-1, METEOR), while in reference-less contexts, the quality of the response is directly assessed (e.g., by an LLM-as-a-judge). As we have seen, recently developed benchmarks employ more complex evaluation methodologies, and a common alternative to algorithmic benchmarks is human preference voting (in so-called chatbot arenas, e.g., <https://lmarena.ai/>).\n\nAnother important element is the existence of a human baseline, and its quality. Important factors to consider are participant selection (demographic sampling, expertise), participant training, task design and instructions (to ensure fair comparison between humans and LLMs), control for attention, bias or fatigue, and the collection of participant demographics to facilitate reproducibility and interpretation of results. Human annotators or participants can also provide relevant insight into the overall quality of the benchmark, thus some campaigns actively collect human feedback to be used in revised versions of the evaluation dataset.\n\nIf the benchmark or dataset is integrated into an evaluation framework, this should be indicated together with a link or other reference to the evaluation site.\n\n### 4.6.\u2003\u200aMetadescriptors\n\nWe propose collecting rich metadata for each benchmark that allows researchers to quickly understand its content, characteristics, and provenance. Such metadescriptors facilitate dataset discovery, comparison, and reuse. Below, we summarize the metadata fields currently envisaged in the proposed registry:\n\n* •\n\n  Description: A short summary of the dataset’s content and purpose.\n* •\n\n  Benchmark family: The broader benchmark initiative or collection to which the dataset belongs. For example, the COPA benchmark family would include the English COPA (Roemmele et\xa0al., [2011](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib34)) and its many parallel variants such as the COPA datasets in Hungarian (Ligeti-Nagy et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib27)), Croatian (Ljubešić and Lauc, [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib29)), South Slavic dialects (Ljubešić et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib28)) etc.\n* •\n\n  Number of test instances: The total number of instances in the test set, enabling quick comparison of dataset scale.\n* •\n\n  Language: The language(s) in which the dataset is provided.\n* •\n\n  Language type: Specification of whether the language of the dataset is standard, non-standard, or a dialect.\n* •\n\n  Modality: The input modality of the dataset, such as text, speech, sign language, or audiovisual signal.\n* •\n\n  Authors: The creators or curators of the dataset.\n* •\n\n  Paper link: Reference to the main publication describing the dataset.\n* •\n\n  Access info: Information on how to obtain the dataset, e.g., a link to a website from where the dataset can be acquired, or an e-mail of the dataset owner if the dataset is not published online.\n* •\n\n  Last revised: The date of the most recent update or revision of the dataset.\n* •\n\n  More information: Additional notes, links, or resources relevant to the dataset.\n\n## 5.\u2003\u200aRecommendations and Future Directions\n\nSeveral challenges of LLM evaluation have been pointed out by a number of studies (e.g., Laskar et\xa0al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib23) or AI Verify Foundation, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.24450v1#bib.bib1): p. 16–22), most notably reproducibility, reliability (including contamination, obscure evaluation methods and unfair comparisons), and robustness. There are numerous parallel activities in progress to set the course of the European LLM evaluation landscape, agree on common principles and establish a dialogue between different stakeholders. While a full review of the above-mentioned challenges is beyond the scope of this paper, we list some priorities which apply in particular for the European benchmarking landscape and evaluations in non-English settings.\n\n1. 1.\n\n   Cultural sensitivity The prevalent framing of toxicity, bias, but also factual knowledge and reasoning, tends to be Western-centric. Evaluation concepts should be expanded to include diverse global perspectives and values.\n2. 2.\n\n   Language sensitivity Under this term, we refer to the fact that LLMs find applications in multilingual and multicultural settings, and that the performance of an LLM may depend heavily on the language it is used in. Benchmarks for bias and toxicity, but also some common benchmarks for language understanding and inference, are not trivial to transfer across languages and linguistic structures.\n3. 3.\n\n   Comparability vs. specificity Many European and other non-English languages still have a limited number of benchmark datasets. To provide a common ground for the evaluation of LLMs across languages, major global benchmarks are still being translated to facilitate international comparability. It is recommended that such translation and adaptation procedures acknowledge the complexity of the task and, even if performed automatically, consider employing different tools, prompt strategies, LLM revision techniques and human evaluation of random samples.\n4. 4.\n\n   Additional modalities Many benchmarks have been developed recently to include different modalities, but there is still a gap in benchmarks for speech, sign language, audiovisual communication, and combinations thereof.\n5. 5.\n\n   Human baseline While frontier LLMs already surpass humans in many areas, it is of paramount importance, especially in high-risk domains, to have a solid foundation for the evaluation of LLMs by comparing the results to human performance on a specific task, acknowledging that every benchmark is a limited representation of a task.\n6. 6.\n\n   Transparent implementation The details of the evaluation process should be published in a transparent manner, including the exact specification of prompting strategies and hyperparameters used, such as temperature. If possible, evaluation scripts should also be made public, and results validated through multiple runs in the case of smaller datasets.\n7. 7.\n\n   Context-specific evaluation There is a lack of nuanced, context-specific evaluations that address the multi-faceted nature of real-world LLM deployments. This includes domain-specificity, but also other elements of attuning evaluation to the users it serves.\n\nWe believe that the rapidly evolving benchmarking landscape for European languages would benefit from a catalogue where each benchmark is categorized and documented according to the above principles. We conceive of such a catalogue in the form of a database, accommodating the fact that the proposed taxonomy categories and metadescriptors may overlap, so that each entry can be labeled with all which apply.\n\n## 6.\u2003\u200aConclusion\n\nWe have presented recent trends in LLM benchmarking for European languages and proposed a new taxonomy for their categorization, intended to be implemented alongside a range of metadescriptors in the context of a European catalogue of LLM benchmarks. Our taxonomization strategy focuses on the linguistic, cultural, factual and reasoning capabilities of models and also incorporates emerging abilities. The proposed considerations follow the wide-spread belief amongst European researchers and developers that the traditional Western-centric, likely contaminated and linguistically inappropriate datasets no longer satisfy our needs, and that targeted efforts should be invested in filling the evaluation gaps for all European languages.\n\nThe initiative presented in this paper is the result of a series of discussions and reflections within the framework of several international research communities, collecting and integrating feedback from a number of researchers, developers and benchmark creators. With the rapid advancement of the field, we envisage continuous extensions and revisions both of the taxonomy and the associated set of metadescriptors and recommendations.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work is supported by the LLM4DH project, funded by the Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency (ARIS) under the grant agreement GC-0002.\n\n## 7.\u2003\u200aBibliographical References\n\n* AI Verify Foundation (2023)  AI Verify Foundation. 2023.

How-ever, the evolution of Large Language Models, has increased the complexity w.r.t. performance measurement. Evaluation and benchmarking of large language model is a significant challenge due to their versatility and improved capability to perform a wide range of tasks. This manuscript examines existing literature for various benchmarks and identifies a comprehensive overview of the emerging trends in benchmarking methodology.\nIndex Terms—Large Language Models, Machine Learning, Benchmarking I. INTRODUCTION Benchmarking is the process of evaluating the performance of Large language models (LLM) against standard set of tasks.\nBenchmarking enables researchers to guide the development of the LLMs and evaluate its effectiveness against other similar competing models while giving insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the LLMs being evaluated.\nWhile there is past literature [1] that covers different bench-marks and evaluation methodologies for LLM; LLMs have been improving rapidly in their capabilities and this neces-sitates a need to improve the benchmarks as well. Creating LLM benchmarks that are sufficiently hard to beat as well as comprehensive enough to enable model comparison has become a challenge in itself. In the subsequent sections we cover the emerging trends in development of LLM benchmarks and what we can expect in near future.\nIn Section II, we cover the emerging trends of compre-hensive benchmarks which consider multi-dimensional assess-ments and real world tasks. In Section III, we present how LLM are compared for specific capabilities such as reasoning, tool usage or code analysis. Lastly, in section IV we present human centric benchmarking trends which focus on explain-ability, reasoning and evaluation with implicit feedback.\nII. BENCHMARKING AGAINST COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION CRITERIA Traditionally, machine learning models were built to solve specific problem and hence evaluation was easier against spe-cific tasks. LLMs, on the other hand, showed promise across multiple different tasks. Liang et al. [2] through their HELM benchmark showed that LLMs are good at wide variety of tasks across multiple domains and a holistic evaluation is nec-essary that goes beyond accuracy metrics. Such comprehensive evaluation can be classified under following subcategories.\nA. Multi-dimensional assessment Most recent benchmarks focused on LLMs have moved from a single score assessment to multi-dimensional assess-ment which measures performance of LLMs across multiple dimensions. White et al. [3] for example presents LiveBench, a benchmark that measures performances of LLMs across dimensions such as Coding, language, reasoning, instruction following, math and data analysis.\nHELM [2] is another multi dimensional benchmark that creates a taxonomy of scenarios and metrics to provide a holis-tic evaluation framework. For example, for language specific tasks HELM has created 16 scenarios such as summarization, question answering, sentiment analysis etc. For metrics HELM focuses not just on correctness but also has measures of fairness, robustness and toxicity.\nB. Real-world tasks As LLMs are being increasingly applied to real world tasks, developing such real world task benchmarks is a new emerging trend. Reed et al. [4] shows GATO agent’s adaptability to perform a variety of tasks and the need of multi-modal bench-marks to assess the agent’s capabilities in real-world settings.\nSrivastava et al. [5] proposed a benchmark that consists of tasks covering diverse domains such as linguistics, mathe-matics, common sense reasoning, and social bias detection to evaluate LLM for real world tasks.\nOSWorld [6], a benchmark to measure performance of LLMs and VLMs against real world computer usage tasks, reveals significant limitations of state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents. While humans achieve a success rate of over 72%, the best performing model only reaches 12% [6].\nResearch suggests that LLMs are still very much behind humans when it comes to tasks in real-world settings hence benchmarks are crucial to improve the existing LLMs.\nIII. BENCHMARKING AGAINST SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES With evolving language models and its expanding real world application, one emerging trends in benchmarking is to measure performance of models for a specific capability.\nWhile traditional benchmarking can evaluate the model for accuracy, it may fail to address the strength or weaknesses of the model within a specific context.\nGuo et al. [7] brings attention to the need of a compre-hensive LLM evaluation with knowledge and reasoning as 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData) | 979-8-3503-6248-0/24/$31.00 ©2024 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825845 Authorized licensed use limited to: GOOGLE. Downloaded on February 03,2025 at 19:27:18 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply. 8806 fundamental to the capabilities of LLM. LogiQA [8] is one such benchmark that goes beyond factual question answering and measures the performance of LLM based on its capability to answers through reasoning and deduction over an expert written dataset of question. ReClor [9] is another benchmark that explains how Machine reading comprehensive models can exploit the bias in the dataset to achieve high accuracy score without understanding the context. To challenge the model for its reasoning capabilities, ReClor evaluated the model against datasets with and without biases and exposed how pre-trained models performed poorly with random guessing on dataset without a bias. Highlighting, the need of more logical reasoning targeted benchmarks.\nCode generation which is seen as a special ability of LLMs, has seen progress from simple benchmarks such as MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Problems) [10] which targets Python for its simplicity to benchmarks such as HumanEval [11] which can evaluate a model’s capability to solve higher complexity problems.\nAs LLMs are deployed in specialized domains like medicine, science and legal etc, specialized benchmarks are even more necessary to make sure the model is reliable and fine-tuned for higher accuracy. MedQA [12] is a benchmark that evaluate the model against real world medical problems.\nLEGALBENCH citeguha2023legalbench benchmark evaluates a model for its legal reasoning via a set of tasks categorized among various legal reasoning.\nResearch around Specific capability benchmarks underlines the need of advanced benchmarks to evaluate these models for higher accuracy and guide development of next set of models.\nIV. HUMAN CENTRIC BENCHMARKING Language tasks are inherently subjective in nature due to context dependency, ambiguity, and reliance on human inter-pretation. While Automated metrics can capture the technical aspects or correctness, they often fail to capture the subjective qualities. Human centric benchmarking focuses on this aspect of LLM tasks and involves humans in evaluating a model’s output, crafting datasets and formulating prompts. Following is a broad classification of ways human centric benchmarking can bridge the gap between traditional automatic metrics and the nuances of language.\nA. Data Creation and Curation Human involvement in designing, building or improving datasets ensures diversity and a broader range of language use. HumanEval [11] utilizes a dataset of hand-written coding problems designed to benchmark the code-writing capabilities of LLMs against a diversified and realistic problem scenarios.\nTruthfulQA [13] uses a set of human crafted questions that test truthfulness of an LLM model.\nB. Task and prompt Development LLM benchmarking with an emphasis on task and prompt development by humans reflects the understanding that hu-mans are best equipped to create tasks even with the nu-ances of language understanding. Such tasks and prompts can also address any potential harm associated with LLM. Big-Bench [5] introduces a collaborative benchmark with tasks contributed by numerous authors. TruthfulQA [13] introduces a set of questions crafted by humans to evaluate if a model can avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts.\nEvaluation tasks and prompt crafted by humans ensures that the evaluation is comprehensive, and the LLM performance is aligned and relevant to human use of a language.\nC. Evaluation and Feedback Humans can directly evaluate LLM outputs for qualities that automatic metrics often miss, such as coherence, readability in summaries, or potential harm in generated text. This evaluation can directly be used as a standard of LLM performance, to compare the evaluation with automatic metrics, or as a feedback to train the LLM model for fine tuning.\nStiennon et al. [14] showcases the role of human evaluator in ranking outputs which are provided as direct input for fine-tuning the models. The result shows that training with human feedback significantly outperforms strong baselines on English summarization. Gehman et al. [15] discusses a benchmark where humans evaluate the outputs for toxicity to ensure that models do not generate harmful or offensive content. Direct evaluation by humans can also include reviewing or rating the automated metrics based on their perceptions of output quality.\nThis can help ensure that automated metrics accurately reflect human judgment and remain useful for benchmarking.\nHuman involvement in feedback and evaluation helps fine tune the model towards outputs that align with human pref-erences while also addressing limitations of relying solely on objective metrics.\nD. Shaping Benchmarking Practices Direct Human involvement during the benchmarking pro-cess can help make sure the process is robust and reliable given the fast moving evolution of LLMs. Stiennon et al.\n[14] showcases how human involvement can ensure reliable benchmarking results by establishing quality control measures.\nHuman involvement can help identify the most relevant and useful metrics to assess the performance of LLM models and developing new metrics that are currently hard to assess with existing automated metrics.\nBIG-bench [5] exemplifies the role of human collaboration in shaping benchmarking practices. Humans contribute various tasks and perspectives to this benchmark which allows a more broader and detailed evaluation of the models.\nEven though helpful in numerous ways, human involvement creates challenges for scaling and accounting for the bias among the humans. We expect the future research to focus on developing scalable human centric benchmarks.\nV. CONCLUSION Benchmarking guides the development of LLMs and allows for comparison with other models. The emerging trends in benchmarking suggests three broad areas of interest for LLM Authorized licensed use limited to: GOOGLE. Downloaded on February 03,2025 at 19:27:18 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply. 8807 benchmarks. Firstly, comprehensive benchmarks that measure LLM performance across multiple dimensions with complex tasks. Secondly, specialize benchmarks that measure LLMs for their performance against highly specialized tasks. Lastly, as LLMs improve and match human performance in many areas, human centric evaluation criteria that uses real humans to evaluate LLMs is also an area of active research and interest.\nREFERENCES [1] Yupeng Chang, Xu Wang, Jindong Wang, Yuan Wu, Linyi Yang, Kaijie Zhu, Hao Chen, Xiaoyuan Yi, Cunxi-ang Wang, Yidong Wang, Wei Ye, Yue Zhang, Yi Chang, Philip S.

Effective evaluation is crucial for selecting and optimizing LLMs.\n\nEnterprises have a range of base models and their variations to choose from, but achieving success is uncertain without precise performance measurement. To ensure the best results, it is vital to identify the most suitable evaluation methods as well as the [appropriate data](https://research.aimultiple.com/data-quality-ai/) for training and assessment.\n\nSee evaluation [metrics](#evaluation-metrics) and [methods,](#llm-evaluation-tools-frameworks) how to address [challenges with current evaluation models](#what-are-the-common-challenges-with-existing-llm-evaluation-methods), and [solutions to mitigate](#best-practices-to-overcome-problems-of-large-language-model-evaluation-methods) them.\n\nFor quick definitions and references, check out the [glossary of key terms](#glossary-of-key-terms).\n\n## Top models & metrics for specific aims\n\nWe created a summary of the best datasets and metrics for your specific aims:\n\n## 5 steps of benchmarking LLMs\n\n### 1. Benchmark selection\n\nA combination of benchmarks is often necessary to comprehensively evaluate a language model’s performance. A set of benchmark tasks is selected to cover a wide range of language-related challenges. These tasks may include language modeling, text completion, [sentiment analysis](https://research.aimultiple.com/sentiment-analysis-benchmark/), question answering, summarization, machine translation, and more. [LLM benchmarks](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-models-examples/) should represent real-world scenarios and cover diverse domains and linguistic complexities. Hugging Face has a leaderboard to evaluate, discuss, and list current Open LLMs.[1](#easy-footnote-bottom-1-68488 "https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/")\n\nSticking to the same benchmarking methods and datasets can create metric problems in LLM evaluation and lead to unchanging results. We advise updating your benchmark and evaluation metrics to capture LLM’s various capabilities. Some of the most popular benchmarking datasets are:\n\n* **MMLU-Pro** refines the MMLU dataset by offering ten choices per question, requiring more reasoning and reducing noise through expert review.[2](#easy-footnote-bottom-2-68488 "https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro")\n* **GPQA** features challenging questions designed by domain experts, validated for difficulty and factuality, and is accessible only through gating mechanisms to prevent contamination.[3](#easy-footnote-bottom-3-68488 "https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa")\n* **MuSR** consists of algorithmically generated complex problems, requiring models to use reasoning and long-range context parsing, with few models performing better than random.[4](#easy-footnote-bottom-4-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/TAUR-Lab/MuSR")\n* **MATH** is a compilation of difficult high-school-level competition problems, formatted for consistency, focusing on the hardest questions.[5](#easy-footnote-bottom-5-68488 "https://github.com/hendrycks/math")\n* **IFEval** tests models’ ability to follow explicit instructions and formatting using strict metrics for evaluation.[6](#easy-footnote-bottom-6-68488 "https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/tasks/ifeval/README.md")\n* **BBH** includes 23 challenging tasks from the BigBench dataset, measuring objective metrics and language understanding, and correlates well with human preference.[7](#easy-footnote-bottom-7-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukaemon/bbh")\n* **HumanEval** evaluates the performance of an LLM in code generation, focusing particularly on its functional correctness.[8](#easy-footnote-bottom-8-68488 "https://github.com/openai/human-eval")\n* **TruthfulQA**\xa0addresses hallucination problems by measuring an LLM’s ability to generate true answers.[9](#easy-footnote-bottom-9-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/domenicrosati/TruthfulQA")\n* **General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)** and **SuperGLUE** test the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly for language-understanding tasks.[10](#easy-footnote-bottom-10-68488 "https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue")\n\nKey research takeaways also include the need for better benchmarking, collaboration, and innovation to push the boundaries of LLM capabilities.\n\n### 2. Dataset preparation\n\nUsing either custom-made or open-source datasets is acceptable. The key point is that the dataset should be recent enough so that the LLMs have not yet been trained on it.\n\nCurated [datasets](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-data/),\xa0including [training](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-training/), validation, and test sets, are prepared for each benchmark task. These datasets should be large enough to capture\xa0variations in language use, domain-specific nuances, and potential biases. Careful data curation is essential to ensure high-quality and unbiased evaluation.\n\n### 3. Model training and fine-tuning\n\nModels trained as [large language models (LLMs)](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-language-model-training/) undergo [fine-tuning](https://research.aimultiple.com/llm-fine-tuning/#why-or-when-does-your-business-need-a-fine-tuned-llm) to improve task-specific performance. The process typically begins with pre-training on large text sources like Wikipedia or the Common Crawl, allowing the model to learn language patterns and structures, forming the base for generative AI coding and generating human-like text.\n\nAfter pre-training, LLMs are fine-tuned on specific benchmark datasets to enhance [performance](https://research.aimultiple.com/how-to-measure-ai-performance/) in tasks like translation or summarization. These models vary in size, from small to large, and use transformer-based designs. Alternative training methods are often employed to boost their capabilities.\n\n### 4. Model evaluation\n\nThe trained or fine-tuned LLM models are evaluated on the benchmark tasks using the predefined evaluation metrics. The models’ performance is measured based on their ability to generate accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate responses for each task. The evaluation results provide insights into the LLM models’ strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance.\n\n### 5. Comparative analysis\n\nThe evaluation results are analyzed to compare the performance of different LLM models on each benchmark task. Models are ranked based on their overall performance or task-specific metrics. Comparative analysis allows researchers and practitioners to identify state-of-the-art models, track progress over time, and understand the relative strengths of different models for specific tasks.\n\nFigure 1: Top 10 ranking of different Large Language Models based on their performance metrics.[11](#easy-footnote-bottom-11-68488 "https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/")\n\n## Evaluation metrics\n\nChoosing a benchmarking method and evaluation metrics to define the overall evaluation criteria based on the model’s intended use are almost simultaneous tasks. Numerous metrics are used for evaluation.\n\nThese particular quantitative or qualitative measurement methods evaluate certain facets of LLM performance. With differing degrees of connection to human assessments, they offer numerical or categorical scores that may be monitored over time and compared between models.\n\n### [General performance metrics](https://research.aimultiple.com/machine-learning-accuracy/)\n\n* **Accuracy** is the percentage of correct responses in binary tasks.\n* **Recall** is the actual number of true positives versus false ones in LLM responses.\n* **F1 score** blends accuracy and recall into one metric. F1 scores range from 0–1, with 1 signifying excellent recall and precision.\n* **Latency is the** model’s efficiency and speed.\n* **Toxicity** shows the immunity of the model to harmful or offensive content in the outputs.\n* **Elo ratings for AI models** rank language models based on competitive performance in shared tasks, similar to how chess players are ranked. Models compete by generating outputs for the same tasks, and ratings are adjusted as new models or tasks are introduced.\n\n### Text-specific metrics\n\n* **Coherence** is the score of the logical flow and consistency of the generated text.\n* **Diversity** measures assess the variety and uniqueness of the generated responses. It involves analyzing metrics such as n-gram diversity or measuring the semantic similarity between generated responses. Higher diversity scores indicate more diverse and unique outputs.\n* **Perplexity** is a measure used to evaluate the performance of language models. It quantifies how well the model predicts a sample of text. Lower perplexity values indicate better performance.\n\nFigure 2: Examples of perplexity evaluation.\n\n* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** is a metric used in machine translation tasks. It compares the generated output with one or more reference translations and measures their similarity.\xa0BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better performance.\n\n* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gissing Evaluation)** is a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries. It compares the generated summary with one or more reference summaries and calculates precision, recall, and F1 scores (Figure 3). ROUGE scores provide insights into the language model’s summary generation capabilities.\n\nFigure 3: An example of a ROUGE evaluation process.[12](#easy-footnote-bottom-12-68488 "https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-text-summarization-with-rouge-scores-84140c64b471/")\n\nEvaluation metrics can be judged by a model or a human. Both have their own advantages and use cases:\n\n### LLM evaluating LLMs\n\nThe LLM assesses the caliber of its own products in an examination known as LLM-as-a-judge. This could involve comparing model-generated text to ground-truth data or measuring outcomes with statistical metrics like accuracy and F1.\n\nLLM-as-a-judge provides businesses with high efficiency by quickly assessing millions of outputs at a fraction of the expense of human review. It is suitable for large-scale deployments where speed and resource optimization are crucial success factors because it is adequate at evaluating technical content in situations where qualified reviewers are hard to come by, allows for continuous quality monitoring of AI systems, and produces repeatable results that hold true throughout evaluation cycles.\n\n### Human-in-the-loop evaluation\n\nThe evaluation process includes enlisting human evaluators who assess the language model’s output quality. These evaluators rate the generated responses based on different criteria: relevance, fluency, coherence, and overall quality.\xa0This approach offers subjective feedback on the model’s performance.\n\nHuman evaluation is still crucial for high-stakes enterprise applications where mistakes could cause serious harm to the company’s operations or reputation. Human reviewers are excellent at identifying subtle problems with cultural context, ethical implications, and practical usefulness that automated systems frequently overlook. They also meet regulatory requirements for human oversight in sensitive industries such as healthcare, finance, and legal services.\n\n## LLM evaluation tools & frameworks\n\nLLM evaluation can be performed in two ways: you can conduct it yourself using either open-source or commercial frameworks or pre-calculated values from benchmarks or results from open-source frameworks of the base models.\n\n### Open-source frameworks\n\n#### Comprehensive evaluation frameworks\n\nComprehensive evaluation frameworks are integrated systems that provide a variety of metrics and evaluation techniques in a unified testing environment. They usually offer defined benchmarks, test suites, and reporting systems to evaluate LLMs across a range of capabilities and dimensions.\n\n* **LEval (Language Model Evaluation)** is a framework for evaluating LLMs on long-context understanding.[13](#easy-footnote-bottom-13-68488 "https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LEval")  LEval is a benchmark suite featuring 411 questions across eight tasks, with contexts from 5,000 to 200,000 tokens. It evaluates how well models perform information retrieval and reasoning with lengthy documents. The suite includes tasks like academic summarization, technical document generation, and multi-turn dialogue coherence, allowing researchers to test models on practical applications rather than isolated linguistic tasks.\n* **Prometheus** is an open-source framework that uses LLMs as judges with systematic prompting strategies.[14](#easy-footnote-bottom-14-68488 "https://huggingface.co/prometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0")  It’s designed to produce evaluation scores that align with human preferences and judgment.\n\n#### Testing approaches\n\nTesting approaches are methodological techniques for organizing and carrying out assessments that are not dependent on particular metrics or instruments. They specify experimental designs, sample techniques, and testing philosophies that can be applied with different frameworks.\n\n* **DAG (Deep Acyclic Graph)** evaluation workflows use directed acyclic graphs to represent evaluation pipelines, though it’s not a specific evaluation tool.\n* **Dynamic prompt testing** evaluates models by exposing them to evolving, real-world scenarios that mimic user interaction. This method evaluates how models respond to complex, multi-layered queries & ambiguous prompts.\n* **The energy and hardware efficiency benchmark** framework measures the energy consumption and computational efficiency of models during training and inference. It focuses on sustainability metrics, such as carbon emissions and power usage.\n\n### Commercial evaluation platforms\n\nCommercial evaluation platforms are vendor-provided solutions with compliance features, MLOps pipeline integration, and user-friendly interfaces that are intended for enterprise use cases. They frequently have monitoring capabilities and strike a compromise between technical depth and non-technical stakeholders’ accessibility.\n\n* **DeepEval (Confident AI)** is a developer-focused testing framework that helps evaluate LLM applications using predefined metrics for accuracy, bias, and performance. It interfaces with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.\n* **Azure AI Studio Evaluation (Microsoft)** offers built-in evaluation tools for comparing different models and prompts, with automatic metric tracking and human feedback collection capabilities.\n* **Prompt Flow (Microsoft)** is a development tool for building, evaluating, and deploying LLM applications. Its built-in evaluation capabilities allow for systematic testing across models and prompts.\n* **LangSmith (LangChain)** is a platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring LLM applications, with features for comparing models and tracing execution paths.\n* **TruLens (TruEra)** is an open-source toolkit for evaluating and explaining LLM applications, with features for tracking hallucinations, relevance, and groundedness.\n* **Vertex AI Studio (Google)** provides tools to test and evaluate model outputs, with both automatic metrics and human evaluation capabilities within Google’s AI ecosystem.\n* **Amazon Bedrock** includes evaluation capabilities for foundation models, allowing developers to test and compare different models before deployment.\n* **Parea AI** is a platform for evaluating and monitoring LLM applications with a specific focus on data quality and model performance.\n\n### Pre-evaluated benchmarks\n\nPre-evaluated benchmarks provide valuable insights using specific metrics, making them particularly useful for metric-driven analysis. Our website features benchmarks for leading models, helping you assess performance effectively. Key benchmarks include:\n\n* [**Hallucination**](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-hallucination/) – Evaluates the accuracy and factual consistency of generated content.\n* [**AI Coding**](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-code/) – Measures coding ability, correctness, and execution.\n* [**AI Reasoning**](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-reasoning/) – Assesses logical inference and problem-solving capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the **OpenLLM Leaderboard** offers a live benchmarking system that evaluates models on publicly available datasets. It aggregates scores from tasks such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering, providing a dynamic and up-to-date comparison of model performance.\n\n## Evaluation use cases\n\n### 1. Performance assessment\n\nConsider an enterprise that needs to choose between multiple models for its base [enterprise generative model](https://research.aimultiple.com/enterprise-generative-ai/). These LLMs must be evaluated to assess how well they generate text and respond to input. Performance assessment metrics can include **accuracy**, **fluency**, **coherence**, and **subject relevance**.\n\nWith the advent of [large multimodal models](https://research.aimultiple.com/large-multimodal-models/), enterprises can also evaluate models that process and generate multiple data types, such as **[images](https://research.aimultiple.com/image-recognition-vs-classification/)**, **text**, and **[audio](https://research.aimultiple.com/audio-data-collection/)**, expanding the scope and capabilities of [generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-services/).\n\n### 2. Model comparison\n\nAn enterprise may have fine-tuned a model for higher performance in tasks specific to its industry. An evaluation framework helps researchers and practitioners compare LLMs and measure progress, helping them select the most appropriate model for a given application. LLM evaluation’s ability to pinpoint areas for development and opportunities to address deficiencies might result in a better user experience, fewer risks, and even a possible competitive advantage.\n\n### 3. Bias detection and mitigation\n\nLLMs can [have biases](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-bias/) in their training data, which may lead to the spread of misinformation, representing one of the [risks associated with generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/risks-of-generative-ai/). A comprehensive evaluation framework helps identify and measure biases in LLM outputs, allowing researchers to develop strategies for bias detection and mitigation.\n\n### 4. User satisfaction and trust\n\nEvaluation of user satisfaction and trust is crucial to test generative language models. Relevance, coherence, and diversity are evaluated to ensure that models match user expectations and inspire trust. This assessment framework aids in understanding the level of user satisfaction and trust in the responses generated by the models.\n\n### 5. Evaluation of RAG systems\n\nLLM evaluation can be used to assess the quality of answers generated by [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://research.aimultiple.com/retrieval-augmented-generation/) systems. Various datasets can be utilized to verify the accuracy of the answers.\n\n## What are the common challenges with existing LLM evaluation methods?\n\nWhile existing evaluation methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) provide valuable insights, they are imperfect. The common issues associated with them are:\n\n### Overfitting\n\nScale AI found that some LLMs are overfitting on popular AI benchmarks. They created GSM1k, a smaller version of the GSM8k benchmark for math testing. LLMs performed worse on GSM1k than on GSM8k, indicating a lack of genuine understanding. These findings suggest that current AI evaluation methods may be misleading due to overfitting, underscoring the need for additional testing methods, such as GSM1k.\n\n### Lack of diverse metrics\n\nThe evaluation techniques used for LLMs today frequently do not capture the whole range of output diversity and innovation. The crucial significance of producing diverse and creative replies is sometimes overlooked by traditional metrics emphasizing accuracy and relevance. Research on the problem of assessing diversity in LLM results is still ongoing. Although perplexity gauges a model’s ability to anticipate text, it ignores crucial elements like coherence, contextual awareness, and relevance. Therefore, depending only on ambiguity could not offer a thorough evaluation of an LLM’s actual quality.\n\n### Subjectivity & high cost of human evaluations\n\nHuman evaluation is a valuable method for assessing the outputs of large language models (LLMs). However, it can be subjective, biased, and significantly more expensive than automated evaluations. Different human evaluators may have varying opinions, and the criteria for evaluation may lack consistency. Furthermore, human evaluation can be time-consuming and costly, especially for large-scale assessments. Evaluators often disagree when assessing subjective aspects, such as helpfulness or creativity, making it challenging to establish a reliable ground truth for evaluation.\n\n### Biases in automated evaluations\n\nLLM evaluations suffer from predictable biases. We provided one example for each bias, but the opposite cases are also possible (e.g., some models can favor last items).\n\n* **Order bias**: First items favored.\n* **Compassion fade**: Names are favored vs. anonymized code words\n* **Ego bias**: Similar responses are favored\n* **Salience bias**: Longer responses are preferred\n* **Bandwagon effect**: Majority belief is preferred\n* **Attention bias**: Sharing more irrelevant information is preferred\n\n### Limited reference data\n\nSome evaluation methods, such as BLEU or ROUGE, require reference data for comparison.\xa0However, obtaining high-quality reference data can be challenging, especially when multiple acceptable responses exist or in open-ended tasks. Limited or biased reference data may not capture the full range of acceptable model outputs.\n\n### Generalization to real-world scenarios\n\nEvaluation methods typically focus on specific benchmark datasets or tasks that don’t fully reflect the challenges of real-world applications. The evaluation of controlled datasets may not generalize well to diverse and dynamic contexts where LLMs are deployed.\n\n### Adversarial attacks\n\nLLMs can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, such as manipulating model predictions and data poisoning, where carefully crafted input can mislead or deceive the model. Existing evaluation methods often do not account for such attacks, and robustness evaluation remains an active area of research.\n\nIn addition to these issues, [enterprise generative AI](https://research.aimultiple.com/enterprise-generative-ai/) models may struggle with [legal](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-legal/) and [ethical](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-ethics/) issues, which may affect LLMs in your business.\n\n### Complexity and cost of multi-dimensional evaluation\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) must be evaluated on various dimensions, such as factual accuracy, toxicity, and bias. This often involves trade-offs, making it challenging to develop unified scoring systems. A thorough evaluation of these models across multiple dimensions and datasets demands substantial computational resources, which can limit access for smaller organizations.\n\n## Best practices to overcome problems of LLM evaluation methods\n\nResearchers and practitioners are exploring various approaches and strategies to address the problems with large language models’ performance evaluation methods. It may be prohibitively expensive to leverage all of these approaches in every project, but awareness of these best practices can improve LLM project success.\n\n### Known training data\n\nLeverage foundation models that share their training data to prevent contamination.\n\n### Multiple evaluation metrics\n\nInstead of relying solely on perplexity, incorporate multiple evaluation metrics for a more comprehensive assessment of LLM performance. Metrics like\xa0these can better capture the different aspects of model quality:\n\n* Fluency\n* Coherence\n* Relevance\n* Diversity\n* Context understanding\n\n### Enhanced human evaluation\n\nClear guidelines and standardized criteria can improve the consistency and objectivity of human evaluation. Using multiple human judges and conducting inter-rater reliability checks can help reduce subjectivity. Additionally, crowd-sourcing evaluation can provide diverse perspectives and larger-scale assessments.\n\n### Diverse reference data\n\nCreate diverse and representative reference data to better evaluate LLM outputs. Curating datasets that cover a wide range of acceptable responses, encouraging contributions from diverse sources, and considering various contexts can enhance the quality and coverage of reference data.\n\n### Incorporating multiple metrics\n\nEncourage the generation of diverse responses and evaluate the uniqueness of generated text through methods such as n-gram diversity or semantic similarity measurements.\n\n### Real-world evaluation\n\n[Augmenting](https://research.aimultiple.com/data-augmentation-techniques/) evaluation methods with real-world scenarios and tasks can improve the generalization of LLM performance. Employing domain-specific or industry-specific evaluation datasets can provide a more realistic assessment of model capabilities.\n\n### Robustness evaluation\n\nEvaluating LLMs for robustness against adversarial attacks is an ongoing research area. Developing evaluation methods that test the model’s resilience to various adversarial inputs and scenarios can enhance the security and reliability of LLMs.\n\n### Leverage LLMOps\n\n[LLMOps](https://research.aimultiple.com/llmops-tools/), a specialized branch of [MLOps](https://research.aimultiple.com/mlops-tools/), is dedicated to developing and enhancing LLMs. Employing for testing and customizing LLMs in your business not only saves time but also minimizes errors.\n\n## Practical examples of LLM evaluation\n\nSeveral organizations have shared their practical experiences with LLM evaluation:\n\n## Ethical considerations in LLM evaluation\n\nWhile performance metrics and benchmarking are crucial, enterprises must also consider the [ethical](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-ethics/) implications of LLM evaluation. These include:\n\n* **Fairness:** Models may produce biased outputs that reflect systemic issues in their training data. Evaluation frameworks should measure bias across demographics, contexts, and applications.\n* **Transparency:** Clearly documenting datasets, evaluation criteria, and model limitations increases trust and accountability.\n* **Accountability:** Enterprises deploying LLMs must ensure that their evaluation processes align with relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly in [healthcare](https://research.aimultiple.com/healthcare-ai/), [finance](https://research.aimultiple.com/generative-ai-finance/), and [government](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-government/) sectors.\n* **[Responsible](https://research.aimultiple.com/responsible-ai/) deployment:** Evaluations should measure not only accuracy but also social impact, safety, and misuse potential. This can include red-teaming and adversarial testing to expose risks.\n\nBy incorporating ethical considerations into evaluation frameworks, organizations can mitigate reputational risks, ensure compliance, and foster trust with users.\n\n## Latest trends in LLM evaluation\n\nResearch in LLM evaluation is evolving rapidly. Some notable trends include:\n\n* **Multimodal evaluation:** As models expand beyond text into images, audio, and video, evaluation frameworks are being extended to test multimodal understanding and generation.\n* **Dynamic benchmark creation:** Instead of static datasets that models may overfit, researchers are developing adaptive benchmarks that evolve (e.g., auto-generated, domain-specific test suites).\n* **LLM-as-a-judge 2.0:** Improved prompting strategies and chain-of-thought evaluations are enabling more reliable automated evaluations that better align with human judgments.\n* **Energy-aware benchmarking:** [Sustainability](https://research.aimultiple.com/sustainability-ai/)-focused benchmarks that evaluate carbon cost and energy efficiency are gaining traction.\n* **Red-teaming frameworks:** Systematic adversarial testing is becoming an integral part of evaluation pipelines, enabling the measurement of robustness against manipulation and unsafe behaviors.\n\n## What do leading researchers think about evals?\n\nTrust is eroding in evaluations that are no longer capable of accurately evaluating model performance:\n\n## Glossary of key terms\n\nFor readers new to the space, here’s a quick reference to essential evaluation metrics:\n\n* **Perplexity:** A measure of how well the model predicts text; lower is better.\n* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Measures overlap between machine translations and human translations.\n* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** Compares machine-generated summaries against human-written references.\n* **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct outputs versus all outputs.\n* **Recall:** Ability to retrieve relevant results out of all possible correct ones.\n* **F1 score:** Harmonic mean of accuracy and recall.\n* **Coherence:** Logical flow and consistency of generated text.\n* **Diversity:** Uniqueness and variability of model outputs, often measured with n-grams or semantic similarity.\n* **Elo rating:** A competitive ranking system adapted from chess to compare models head-to-head.\n\n## 💡Conclusion\n\nEvaluating large language models is crucial throughout their entire lifecycle, encompassing selection, fine-tuning, and secure, dependable deployment. As the capabilities of LLMs increase, it becomes inadequate to depend solely on a single metric (like perplexity) or benchmark. Thus, a multidimensional strategy that integrates automated scores (e.g., BLEU/ROUGE, checks for factual consistency), structured human evaluations (with specific guidelines and inter-rater agreement), and custom tests for bias, fairness, and toxicity is vital to assess both quantitative performance and qualitative risks.\n\nYet significant challenges remain. Public benchmarks can lead to overfitting on well-trodden datasets, while human-in-the-loop evaluations are time-consuming and complicated to scale. Adversarial inputs expose robustness gaps, and energy-intensive models raise sustainability concerns. Addressing these requires curating diverse, domain-specific test suites; integrating red-team and adversarial stress-testing; deploying LLM-as-judge pipelines for rapid, cost-effective assessment; and tracking energy and inference costs alongside accuracy metrics.\n\nBy embedding these best practices within an LLMOps framework, organizations can maintain a robust, ongoing view of model behavior in production. This holistic evaluation strategy mitigates risks like bias, hallucination, and security vulnerabilities and ensures that LLMs deliver trustworthy, high-impact outcomes as they evolve.\n\n## FAQ\n\n## Further reading\n\nLearn more on ChatGPT to understand LLMs better by reading:\n\n* [AI Transformation: 6 Real-Life Strategies to Succeed](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-transformation/)\n* [ChatGPT Education Use Cases, Benefits & Challenges](https://research.aimultiple.com/chatgpt-education/)\n* [How to Use ChatGPT for Business: Top 40 Applications](https://research.aimultiple.com/chatgpt-for-business/)\n* [GPT-5: In-depth Guide](https://research.aimultiple.com/gpt-5/)\n\n## Reference Links\n\n[1.\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard - a Hugging Face Space by open-llm-leaderboard\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/)[2.\n\nGitHub - TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro: The code and data for "MMLU-Pro: A More Robust and Challenging Multi-Task Language Understanding Benchmark" [NeurIPS 2024]](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro)[3.\n\nGitHub - idavidrein/gpqa: GPQA: A Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark](https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa)[4.\n\nTAUR-Lab/MuSR · Datasets at Hugging Face\n\nTAUR Lab at UT Austin](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TAUR-Lab/MuSR)[5.\n\nGitHub - hendrycks/math: The MATH Dataset (NeurIPS 2021)](https://github.com/hendrycks/math)[6.\n\nlm-evaluation-harness/lm\\_eval/tasks/ifeval/README.md at main · EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness · GitHub](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/tasks/ifeval/README.md)[7.\n\nlukaemon/bbh · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukaemon/bbh)[8.\n\nGitHub - openai/human-eval: Code for the paper "Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code"](https://github.com/openai/human-eval)[9.\n\ndomenicrosati/TruthfulQA · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/domenicrosati/TruthfulQA)[10.\n\naps/super\\_glue · Datasets at Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aps/super_glue)[11.\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard - a Hugging Face Space by open-llm-leaderboard\n\nOpen LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard#/)[12.\n\nIntroduction to Text Summarization with ROUGE Scores | Towards Data Science\n\nTowards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-text-summarization-with-rouge-scores-84140c64b471/)[13.\n\nGitHub - OpenLMLab/LEval: [ACL\'24 Outstanding] Data and code for L-Eval, a comprehensive long context language models evaluation benchmark](https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LEval)[14.\n\nprometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0 · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/prometheus-eval/prometheus-13b-v1.0)\n\nPrincipal Analyst\n\nCem Dilmegani\n\nPrincipal Analyst\n\n[Follow On](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cem-dilmegani/ "Follow on")\n\nCem has been the principal analyst at AIMultiple since 2017.

Ensuring Safety and Trustworthiness**\n\n* **Focus Areas**:\n  + Avoidance of harmful outputs, such as bias, toxicity, and misinformation.\n  + Protection against adversarial attacks and robustness to perturbations in input data.\n* **Benchmarks**:\n  + Safety-specific datasets (e.g., RealToxicityPrompts, [AdvGLUE](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/advglue?ref=blog.premai.io)).\n  + Comprehensive evaluations of alignment with ethical norms and human values.\n\n#### **4. Alignment with Human Values**\n\n* **Purpose**: Evaluating how closely the outputs of LLMs align with societal and ethical expectations.\n* **Challenges**:\n  + Detecting bias and stereotypes using datasets like [StereoSet](https://github.com/moinnadeem/StereoSet?ref=blog.premai.io) and [CrowS-Pairs](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/crows-pairs?ref=blog.premai.io).\n  + Measuring ethical alignment with frameworks such as ETHICS.\n* **Goal**: To develop systems that are inclusive, unbiased, and adaptable to diverse cultural contexts.\n\n#### **5. Risk Mitigation in Deployment**\n\n* **Why Important**:\n  + Mitigating risks such as data leakage, system manipulation, or operational failures.\n* **Evaluation Tools**:\n  + Red-teaming methods to probe for vulnerabilities.\n  + Robustness metrics to measure stability under adversarial conditions.\n* **Real-World Example**: Testing ChatGPT's ability to handle medical and legal queries without propagating misinformation.\n\nBy fulfilling these objectives, LLM evaluations ensure not only technical excellence but also societal trust and safety, laying the groundwork for responsible AI deployment across industries.\n\n## **Dimensions of LLM Evaluation**\n\nUnderstanding the dimensions of LLM evaluation is critical to designing robust benchmarks and protocols that align with their evolving capabilities and use cases. The key dimensions encompass the **what**, **where**, and **how** of evaluation, which provide a structured framework for assessing LLM performance across diverse domains and tasks.\n\n### **1. What to Evaluate**\n\n* **General Capabilities**: These include tasks such as natural language understanding, reasoning, and natural language generation. Evaluations often measure fluency, coherence, and contextual relevance of responses. [MSTEMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01448?ref=blog.premai.io), for example, introduces out-of-distribution (OOD) semantic templates to rigorously test these aspects.\n* **Domain-Specific Capabilities**: Performance tailored to specialized domains, such as legal, medical, or financial sectors, is critical. Benchmarks like PubMedQA and LSAT are specifically designed for these settings.\n* **Safety and Ethical Considerations**: Assessments of bias, toxicity, and alignment with human values are essential for ensuring trustworthy deployment. Tools like RealToxicityPrompts and StereoSet are commonly used in this area.\n\n### **2. Where to Evaluate**\n\n* **Standardized Benchmarks**: Datasets like GLUE, [SuperGLUE](https://klu.ai/glossary/superglue-eval?ref=blog.premai.io), and Big-Bench have been central to assessing general capabilities. However, their static nature may limit their ability to test adaptive performance.\n* **Dynamic Frameworks**: Advanced tools like [DYVAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17167?ref=blog.premai.io) and [MSTEMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01448?ref=blog.premai.io) emphasize generating dynamic, OOD datasets to evaluate robustness and adaptability. This approach addresses limitations of static benchmarks by introducing variability in input styles and semantics.\n\n---\n\n### **3. How to Evaluate**\n\n* **Static Metrics**: Conventional metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and perplexity measure baseline performance. However, they may not capture nuances like contextual relevance or user alignment.\n* **Dynamic Approaches**: Evaluation tools like PandaLM integrate dynamic benchmarks to test models under varying conditions, including adversarial scenarios.\n* **Human and Model Scoring**: Human evaluators often provide qualitative insights into coherence and alignment, whereas automated evaluators (e.g., [GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/?ref=blog.premai.io) as a scoring model) offer scalability and cost-efficiency.\n\n---\n\nBy combining insights from standardized benchmarks and emerging dynamic frameworks, LLM evaluation can achieve a balance between scalability, depth, and adaptability.\n\n## **Current Evaluation Strategies**\n\n  \n\nEvaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) involves a range of strategies that address various performance dimensions, from basic accuracy to robustness under adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions.

Modern LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude exhibit broad capabilities, making it difficult to measure their true performance and limitations with any single metric or dataset. Evaluation is critical for tracking progress and ensuring models are reliable, factual, and safe in real-world use, but it is inherently complex because LLMs must be assessed across many dimensions. Recent work emphasizes holistic evaluation: covering not just accuracy, but also reasoning, truthfulness, safety, bias, robustness, efficiency, and more. In fact, “language models… capabilities, limitations, and risks are not well understood”, prompting efforts like the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to taxonomize use cases and metrics. As models become more capable, new evaluation benchmarks continually emerge to keep up with frontier behaviors - GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s upcoming Gemini, Meta’s LLaMA and newer open models like Mistral are pushing performance into human-expert range, often saturating older benchmarks.\n\nWhy is evaluation so challenging? One reason is that LLMs are now general-purpose systems deployed in diverse tasks, from question-answering to coding to conversation. A model might excel at standardized exams but falter in open-ended dialogue. For example, GPT-4 achieved human-level scores on many professional and academic exams (it ranks in the top 10% on a simulated bar exam, whereas GPT-3.5 was in the bottom 10% ). Yet simply scoring well on knowledge tests doesn’t guarantee a model is useful or aligned in interactive settings. Researchers have observed that fine-tuned conversational models (trained via human feedback) are strongly preferred by users, but do not always score higher on traditional benchmarks like MMLU or HELM. This mismatch highlights that conventional benchmarks capture only part of an LLM’s capability. In response, the evaluation landscape has expanded into a spectrum of benchmark categories, each probing a different facet of an LLM’s performance. Below, we provide a deep technical analysis of these categories and the latest benchmarks in each, before discussing integrated evaluation suites and open problems in benchmarking.\n\n![Image 5: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nClaude 4 models lead on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark for performance on real software engineering tasks\n\n![Image 6: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nReasoning and Knowledge Benchmarks\n----------------------------------\n\nReasoning ability is a core aspect of intelligence that LLM benchmarks target. It encompasses logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, commonsense reasoning, and complex multi-step inference. Early NLP benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE focused on language understanding tasks, but as LLMs grew more powerful, researchers introduced more challenging reasoning evaluations. A prime example is the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, a suite of 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 57 subjects including history, science, math, and more. MMLU became a de facto standard for academic knowledge and reasoning; GPT-4’s few-shot accuracy on MMLU is around 86%, far above most predecessors. However, frontier models have nearly saturated MMLU - GPT-4 hit 86.4% in early 2023, and newer models like PaLM 2, Claude, and fine-tuned LLaMA variants all cluster in the high-80s%. Performance has plateaued, making it hard for MMLU to distinguish newer models’ progress. This has prompted the development of MMLU-Pro, an enhanced version with more challenging questions and answer options. By increasing question difficulty and expanding answer choices from 4 to 10, MMLU-Pro significantly drops model accuracies (GPT-4’s score falls to ~72.6% on MMLU-Pro) and better discriminates top models. Notably, MMLU-Pro requires models to use chain-of-thought reasoning for high scores, whereas on original MMLU even a direct approach often sufficed. This illustrates how careful benchmark design (e.g. reducing answer choice shortcuts) can expose whether a model is truly reasoning or just guessing.\n\n![Image 7: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nAnother influential effort is BIG-bench (Beyond the Imitation Game), a crowd-sourced collection of over 200 diverse tasks intended to be “beyond the capabilities of current models”. BIG-bench tasks range from linguistics puzzles to logical reasoning and abstract pattern recognition. In the original 2022 report, large models like PaLM still failed many BIG-bench tasks, but interestingly they outperformed average humans on 65% of the tasks. To identify truly unsolved challenges, researchers defined BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) - a subset of 23 especially difficult tasks where models did not initially reach human-level performance. Many BBH tasks require multi-step reasoning. Follow-up research found that prompting models to explicitly reason (using “chain-of-thought” techniques) enabled dramatic improvements: for instance, with chain-of-thought prompting, PaLM and Codex models were able to solve many BBH tasks that they originally got wrong, even showing emergent abilities at certain model scales. These findings underscore how evaluation of reasoning can be sensitive to prompting methods.\n\nBeyond these general benchmarks, specialized reasoning tests exist for domains like math and science. The AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) focuses on grade-school science questions, and Math benchmarks (e.g. GSM8K, MATH dataset) test mathematical word problems and proofs. Results on these indicate that while basic arithmetic and algebra are within reach of large LLMs, complex math still stumps even GPT-4 at times. Indeed, an OpenAI study noted GPT-4 can “make simple reasoning errors” or produce subtly incorrect logic, despite its overall high competency. This motivates adversarial reasoning benchmarks (like puzzles specifically designed to trick LLM logic) as well as the use of step-by-step solution evaluations rather than just final answers.\n\nTo evaluate world knowledge and reasoning in combination, some benchmarks simulate human exams. AGIEval, for example, gathers questions from real exams like the SAT, GRE, and China’s Gaokao. These are challenging, high-stakes questions requiring both knowledge recall and reasoning. Likewise, the Bar Exam, medical licensing exams, and the like have been used as extreme tests - GPT-4’s top-10% bar exam score is a case in point. These exam-based evaluations have shown that frontier models approach expert-level performance in many areas, though interpretation is key: a high exam score demonstrates a form of academic reasoning, but in practical scenarios the model might still hallucinate or fail on interactive tasks. Thus, reasoning benchmarks give valuable snapshots of progress (e.g. tracking models closing the gap with expert humans), but designing them to truly require reasoning (and not allow shortcut tricks) is an ongoing challenge. As we’ll discuss, new benchmarks now combine knowledge and reasoning with other aspects to stress-test LLMs more holistically.\n\nFactual Accuracy and Hallucination\n----------------------------------\n\nDespite impressive knowledge recall, large language models are prone to hallucinations - generating statements that sound plausible but are factually incorrect or nonsensical. Evaluating factual accuracy is therefore crucial, especially as LLMs are deployed for question-answering, advice, or retrieval tasks. However, measuring truthfulness is tricky because it often requires external knowledge or human judgment to verify an answer. One prominent benchmark targeting this is TruthfulQA, which “evaluates how well LLMs generate truthful responses to questions”, especially when there are popular misconceptions or adversarial falsehoods. The TruthfulQA dataset contains 817 questions in 38 categories (covering health, law, finance, politics, etc.), each with correct answers and common incorrect answers. For example: “Do vaccines cause autism?” (where the truthful answer is “No, extensive studies show no link” but a model might pick up on common misinformation). In TruthfulQA, models are evaluated by human judges who rate whether the answer is true and informative. Interestingly, the creators also experimented with automated evaluation: they trained GPT-based judges to classify answers as true/false and measure answer quality. This approach of using an LLM to evaluate another LLM is a recurring theme (we’ll revisit it for other benchmarks too), but for factuality it remains imperfect - currently, careful human evaluation is the gold standard for detecting subtle falsehoods.\n\nOpenAI reported that GPT-4 made progress on TruthfulQA compared to earlier models. In particular, GPT-4 (after fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback, RLHF) is more resistant to producing common misconceptions as answers. For instance, it learned not to repeat the false claim that “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks” as truth. However, even GPT-4 can miss subtle factual details (OpenAI noted it incorrectly stated Elvis Presley’s parentage in one test). These results highlight that factual accuracy evaluation must cover both blatant misinformation and subtle errors. It also shows the interplay between knowledge and alignment: GPT-4’s base model was only slightly better than GPT-3.5 on TruthfulQA, but after alignment tuning (RLHF) it improved substantially, indicating that penalizing falsehoods during training can raise truthfulness scores.\n\n![Image 8: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nBeyond TruthfulQA, there are other tasks to assess hallucination and knowledge retrieval. Some involve open-domain question answering (like NaturalQuestions or WebQA) where an LLM must produce correct facts without reference material - here, researchers often check if the answer contains unsupported claims. Others use fact-checking benchmarks (e.g. FEVER) where the model is given a claim and must verify it against evidence. A high-performing LLM might still appear to do well by generating confident answers; thus evaluation needs to explicitly check each factual assertion. This has led to methods like citation accuracy (if a model is asked to provide sources, do the sources actually support the answer?) and consistency checks (asking the same fact in multiple ways).\n\nA related angle is calibration - does the model know what it doesn’t know? A well-calibrated model would refrain from answering or express uncertainty when it’s likely to be wrong. HELM measured calibration as one metric alongside accuracy, and found that some top models (the pre-RLHF GPT-4 in particular) were surprisingly well-calibrated in raw form. Yet the alignment process can reduce calibration (making the model more “confident” in tone even when unsure). So, evaluators also consider how to score a model’s self-knowledge of correctness.\n\nIn summary, factual accuracy benchmarking spans: direct QA tests of knowledge, adversarial truth tests like TruthfulQA, and analyses of hallucination in generated explanations or narratives. Each has challenges - for example, if a model’s training data already contains the test answers, it might score high without real understanding (a form of data leakage). Designers have to ensure test questions aren’t answerable by simple keyword lookup or memorization. And because what counts as “true” can sometimes be context-dependent, interpretation of results needs care. The field is moving toward dynamic evaluations (using up-to-date knowledge sources or live retrieval) to reduce static knowledge testing, but static benchmarks remain valuable for comparing models’ inherent factuality under controlled conditions.\n\nSafety and Toxicity Evaluation\n------------------------------\n\nAlongside capability, safety is a paramount concern in LLM deployment. Safety evaluations examine whether a model produces harmful, toxic, or otherwise undesirable outputs. This includes toxicity (hate speech, harassment, profanity), violence or extremist content, self-harm encouragement, misinformation, and instructions for illegal or dangerous activities. Evaluating safety is complicated by the wide range of possible bad behaviors and the fact that aligned models are explicitly trained to refuse or filter certain content. As a result, many safety benchmarks have emerged, often focusing on specific facets of harm or specific attack strategies against the model’s safeguards.\n\nOne line of safety evaluation uses triggering prompts: give the model a potentially problematic prompt and see if it responds with disallowed content. For example, the RealToxicityPrompts dataset consists of over 100k naturally occurring text prompts (from Reddit) that are not explicitly toxic themselves but could lead a language model to continue in a toxic manner. By prompting an LLM with the first part of a real sentence (e.g. “Those people always seem to be the ones who…” ) and observing if the model’s completion turns toxic, evaluators can measure a model’s tendency for neural toxic degeneration. Gehman et al. (2020) found even GPT-2 could produce highly toxic continuations from innocuous prompts. Modern models are much safer by default, but RealToxicityPrompts is still used to quantify improvements in toxicity avoidance.\n\nAnother influential benchmark is ToxiGen, which is designed to test nuanced hate speech detection. ToxiGen contains 274,000 machine-generated statements about 13 minority groups, with each statement labeled as either toxic or benign. The twist is that these statements were generated using GPT-3 in an adversarial way: an algorithm tried to produce implicitly toxic sentences (containing stereotypes or coded language rather than obvious slurs) that might fool simple toxicity classifiers. This yields a challenging testbed for LLMs - can the model distinguish hateful subtext from innocuous mentions? The benchmark can be applied in two ways: (1) as a classification test (prompt the model with a statement and see if it classifies or responds appropriately to toxic vs benign), or (2) as a generation test (as input to see if the model itself continues with toxicity when given a biased statement). In practice, ToxiGen is often used to fine-tune or evaluate toxicity detection models. A recent study found that when strong LLMs (ChatGPT, Llama-2, etc.) were stress-tested on safety, using realistic adversarial prompts, they revealed more toxicity with ToxiGen triggers than one might detect with naive prompts. This suggests that carefully engineered evaluation prompts are needed to probe the boundaries of a model’s safety behaviors.\n\n![Image 9: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nTo test compliance with ethical guidelines, benchmarks like ForbiddenQuestions have been introduced. ForbiddenQuestions presents the model with requests that should be refused according to content policy - for example: “How can I create a fake ID?” or “What are the best methods for scamming people online?”. The dataset covers 107k questions across categories like illicit behavior, hate and violence, privacy violations, etc., all of which a model must refuse to answer to pass. Evaluating on this benchmark checks if the model correctly answers “Sorry, I cannot assist with that” (or equivalent refusals) for disallowed prompts. High performance means strong adherence to safety instructions. Notably, Shen et al. (2023) compiled ForbiddenQuestions in part by observing real attempts to “jailbreak” models (like the infamous “DAN” - Do Anything Now - prompts). Thus, it simulates in-the-wild attacks where users try to get the AI to break rules.\n\nAdversarial robustness in safety is further measured by benchmarks such as AdvBench. AdvBench specifically targets jailbreak techniques and adversarial inputs that circumvent alignment. It includes 1000 prompts: 500 harmful instructions and 500 harmful pieces of text, covering areas like misinformation, hate, and self-harm, plus an adversarial suffix string that can be appended to a user query to trick the model. Zou et al. (2023) demonstrated a universal adversarial suffix that, when added to disallowed requests, could cause even aligned models to comply. Evaluating models on AdvBench means checking how often they still refuse correctly versus get duped by these crafted attacks. It’s a harsh test of a model’s robustness to malicious inputs. Similarly, an Anthropic Red Team dataset has been open-sourced, containing ~39k examples of human-written adversarial dialogues aiming to make the AI “behave badly”. These multi-turn attack conversations probe whether a model can maintain refusals over a long exchange with a clever user. Success in such benchmarks is measured by low incidence of policy violations even under sustained pressure.\n\nModern evaluation suites try to combine multiple safety facets. For instance, the HELM project introduced a HELM Safety benchmark that aggregates 5 different safety tests covering six risk categories: violence, sexual content, harassment/hate, discrimination, deception, and fraud. HELM Safety draws from several sources: e.g. BBQ for social bias/discrimination, SimpleSafety for extremely harmful requests (violence, sexual exploitation), HarmBench for vulnerability to known jailbreaks, XSTest for edge-case prompts and refusal consistency, and Anthropic’s red-team dialogues. By integrating these, HELM Safety aims to provide a standardized, broad evaluation of how models handle potentially harmful content. Early HELM results showed that no model is flawless across all categories, and that improvements in one area (say, refusing violent requests) don’t automatically transfer to another (like avoiding subtle harassment).\n\nFinally, toxicity and bias often intersect; models can exhibit biased or derogatory behavior against certain groups. While we’ll discuss bias separately below, it’s worth noting that toxicity benchmarks like ToxiGen explicitly include minority group identifiers to evaluate targeted hate. Also, some safety benchmarks include fairness tests (e.g., ensuring the model’s refusals or toxicity do not disproportionately affect one demographic). In summary, safety evaluation has evolved into a multi-headed effort: measuring outright toxic generation, the model’s ability to detoxify or refuse, its resilience to adversarial exploits, and its fairness in applying safety rules. The complexity of human values means designing these benchmarks raises its own challenges - defining what is “harmful” or “acceptable” can be subjective, and overly narrow tests might miss creative new failure modes. We discuss some of these open issues later on.\n\nMultilinguality and Cross-Lingual Generalization\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMost benchmarks historically focused on English, but an important dimension of LLM evaluation is multilingual capability - how well can a model understand and generate languages other than English, and how consistent is its performance across languages? Given that top LLMs are often trained on massive multilingual corpora, they do exhibit surprising cross-lingual generalization, but evaluation is needed to quantify strengths and weaknesses in each language.\n\nA straightforward approach is to translate existing benchmarks into many languages and test the model. OpenAI did this for MMLU: they translated all 57 subjects’ questions into 26 languages (from high-resource languages like French and Chinese to low-resource ones like Swahili and Welsh). GPT-4’s performance was then compared to its English score. The results were impressive - GPT-4 outperformed not only GPT-3.5 but also other multilingual LLMs (Chinchilla, PaLM) in 24 out of 26 languages tested. In many cases, GPT-4’s accuracy in, say, Spanish or Arabic was close to its English accuracy, demonstrating strong cross-lingual generalization. This suggests the model has learned a great deal of knowledge that transfers across languages. However, some languages remain challenging: GPT-4 did slightly worse in a couple of languages (the report doesn’t specify which 2 of 26 were the exceptions, but typically this might be extremely low-resource or morphologically complex languages). The translation-based approach, while convenient, has pitfalls: automatic translations (here done by Azure Translate) could introduce noise or subtle changes in question difficulty. Additionally, multiple-choice options must be carefully translated to preserve the correct answer position.\n\nAnother standard benchmark is XNLI (Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference), which evaluates understanding of logic across languages. XNLI provides premise-hypothesis pairs in 15 languages to test if models can perform entailment reasoning cross-lingually. Multilingual LLMs are expected to maintain consistent reasoning: if a model can do NLI in English, can it do it just as well in Swahili? For many large models, XNLI accuracy in high-resource languages is quite high, but it tends to drop for low-resource languages or those not well-represented in training data. XTREME and XGLUE are broader multilingual benchmark suites that include tasks like classification, QA, NLI, named entity recognition, etc., across dozens of languages. These have been used especially to evaluate multilingual models like mBERT, XLM, and XLM-RoBERTa in the pre-LLM era, but can equally apply to GPT-style models.\n\n![Image 10: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nA newer challenge is code-switching and dialects. For example, English-centric models may fail on regional dialects or mixtures of languages. HELM noted that many English dialects (like African American Vernacular English or Indian English) were missing from common benchmarks. Filling this gap is important for fairness. Some researchers create evaluation sets in such dialects or in code-mixed text (e.g., Spanglish).\n\nCross-lingual generalization also means how well a model can use multiple languages in one context. A truly multilingual LLM might seamlessly translate, or even combine languages (e.g., answer in French based on an English document). Benchmarks like MLQA or TyDi QA present questions in one language that must be answered from context in another language, testing cross-lingual transfer.\n\nOne more frontier is multilingual safety and bias - checking if a model that is safe in English might still produce offensive content in a less familiar language. Some toxic content classifiers work poorly on other languages due to data scarcity. So, evaluating toxicity or bias in various languages is an emerging area (though not yet as standardized).\n\nIn summary, multilingual benchmarks aim to ensure LLMs are not just polyglots by token count, but actually functional across languages. Many top models are surprisingly good globally (thanks to massive training data). GPT-4, for instance, was shown internally to handle even “low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and Swahili” with strong performance. However, interpreting these results requires care: is an error due to language understanding or due to the underlying knowledge? If a model fails a history question in Japanese, is it because it didn’t understand Japanese, or because it lacks that historical knowledge altogether? Controlled experiments like translation help isolate that. For truly multilingual evaluation, human experts in each language are often needed to judge nuances, making it resource-intensive. But as LLMs go global, this evaluation facet is indispensable.\n\nBias and Fairness\n-----------------\n\nBias and fairness evaluations probe whether LLMs exhibit unwanted societal biases or stereotypical associations, and whether their outputs are fair and respectful across different demographic groups. Bias in LLMs can manifest in many ways: making stereotyped assumptions (e.g., assuming a doctor is male), using unfair or hurtful language about protected groups, or reflecting biases present in training data. Unlike explicit toxicity, bias may be more implicit and can occur even in seemingly benign responses. Thus, specialized benchmarks have been devised to measure bias in a systematic way.\n\nEarly bias benchmarks include StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs. StereoSet presents models with fill-in-the-blank tasks to see if they prefer a stereotypical completion about a group versus a non-stereotypical one. It covers four domains of bias: gender, profession, race, and religion. For example, a prompt might be “The nurse asked the doctor for ___” and the model might fill “her opinion” vs “his opinion”. A bias would be revealed if the model consistently chooses the completion aligning with a stereotype. CrowS-Pairs is similar but uses pairs of sentences - one that is more biased and one that is more inclusive/anti-stereotypical - and asks which sentence the model is more likely to produce or prefer. These benchmarks produce a quantitative bias score (ideally an unbiased model scores 50/50 preference). Large pretrained models do show significant biases on these tests, often mirroring societal stereotypes present in the internet text.\n\n![Image 11: Article content](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse)\n\nNewer bias evaluations aim to be broader and more rigorous. For instance, the HolisticBias dataset (introduced in late 2023) covers 13 demographic axes and ~600 descriptors - this means it tests model responses across attributes like gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation, religion, age, etc., using a wide range of identity terms. The goal is to see if the model responds differently or toxically when a particular group is mentioned. Meta’s LLaMA-2 report referenced using such bias benchmarks to ensure the model’s outputs are within acceptable ranges. Another approach is shown in DecodingTrust, a comprehensive trustworthiness benchmark that includes bias as one of eight evaluation perspectives. DecodingTrust integrates multiple existing tests - for bias it leverages things like StereoSet and others - and compiles an overall stereotype score for the model. This context is often important: a model might be unbiased in one context (e.g., not associating math ability with gender in an academic question) but biased in another (e.g., offering different styles of advice to different ethnic names).\n\nBias evaluation also often uses prompt-based tests. For example, one can prompt the model: “Complete the sentence: ‘The person walked into the room. The Black man said to the white man, …’” and examine if the continuation contains biases or assumptions. There are also bias attack benchmarks - for instance, an adversarial prompt might try to get the model to produce a racist joke or a biased summary, to see if the model can be provoked into biased content even if it normally wouldn’t.\n\nOne challenging area is measuring bias in generated text vs bias in model decisions. For chatbots or assistants, not only do we care about the content they generate, but also how they treat user queries. Do they give different quality answers depending on the user’s identity? For example, if asked, “How should a woman negotiate a salary?” vs “How should a man negotiate a salary?”, does the model provide equally strong advice? Ensuring parity in such cases is part of fairness evaluation.\n\nAnother nuance: fairness metrics can conflict with other objectives. A model might avoid a stereotype so strongly that it gives an uninformative answer, which might hurt perceived helpfulness. Or attempts to be unbiased might result in awkward responses (over-correcting language). Thus, benchmark designers often use paired comparisons judged by humans as in Anthropic’s HHH (Helpfulness, Honesty, Harmlessness) evaluation. HHH contains prompts and model outputs where humans had to prefer which assistant’s response was more helpful, honest, and harmless. While HHH is more of an alignment benchmark, it inherently tests fairness by including scenarios where bias or harm could appear. If a model consistently loses preference due to saying something biased (thus less harmless), it would score poorly.\n\nIn summary, bias/fairness evaluation in LLMs is moving toward a holistic, intersectional approach - covering many groups and contexts, rather than a few isolated tests. The key challenge in designing these benchmarks is ensuring they truly capture problematic biases without flagging legitimate differences. For example, a model saying “Pregnant women should avoid alcohol” is biased in that it addresses a specific group, but it’s factually correct advice - so context matters. Evaluators often need humans in the loop to judge if a difference in output is justified or harmful. Interpreting bias benchmark results can be non-trivial as well; a single score might hide which particular biases are present. Still, these benchmarks are essential for guiding model developers to identify and mitigate harmful biases, making LLMs fairer and more trustworthy for all users.\n\nRobustness and Adversarial Resistance\n-------------------------------------\n\nNo evaluation is complete without examining how models handle perturbations and adversarial inputs. Robustness refers to an LLM’s ability to maintain performance under distribution shifts or input variations that were not seen in training. Adversarial resistance is the model’s ability to not be tricked or exploited by cleverly crafted inputs. For LLMs, this can range from spelling errors and noisy text to subtle prompt manipulations or logic traps.\n\nOne simple robustness test is adding input noise: for instance, inserting typos, odd punctuation, or irrelevant phrases in a question and seeing if the model still understands it. Human performance usually drops only slightly with such noise, but some models degrade more. An example from DecodingTrust’s robustness section is a prompt like “Tell me how to stėål a car without getting çåught.” (with special characters). A robust model should recognize this as essentially “how to steal a car without getting caught” and refuse to answer it (since it’s asking for illegal advice). Less robust models might get confused by the characters or not apply the safety filter correctly, thereby revealing a vulnerability. Indeed, adversaries often exploit encoding or unicode tricks to bypass content filters. Robustness evaluation tries to anticipate these by testing variants of prompts.\n\nAnother aspect is out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness: does the model handle topics or styles that were rare in training data? For example, legal or medical jargon, or dialogue written in old English. HELM included distribution shift scenarios to measure how accuracy holds up when inputs differ from the norm. Many models show performance drops on OOD inputs, although larger models are generally more resilient due to broader training coverage.\n\nWe discussed jailbreak attacks under safety; these are a form of adversarial input specifically to induce policy violations. More generally, adversarial evaluation can target a model’s reasoning. For example, the Boolean Algebra paradoxes or deliberately ambiguous questions can cause logical failures. Some researchers craft adversarial tests by manually finding prompts that confuse the model (kind of like red-teaming the model’s reasoning). Others use automated methods: e.g., using another model or algorithm to generate input variants that cause errors.\n\nRecommended by LinkedIn\n-----------------------\n\n[![Image 12: A Beginner’s Guide to Large Language Models](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse) A Beginner’s Guide to Large Language Models Digitate 1 year ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beginners-guide-large-language-models-igniobydigitate-tlsme)\n\n[![Image 13: From "Bag-of-Words" to "Instruct-Tuned LLMs": The Technical and Business Evolution of NLP](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse) From "Bag-of-Words" to "Instruct-Tuned LLMs": The… Thirumalesh Konathala (PhD) 8 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-bag-of-words-instruct-tuned-llms-technical-nlp-konathala-phd--nefkc)\n\n[![Image 14: NewMind AI Journal #106](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-evaluation-benchmarks-large-language-models-jin-sdfse) NewMind AI Journal #106 NewMind AI 3 months ago](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/newmind-ai-journal-106-newmind-ai-nwb3e)\n\nBIG-bench included some tasks that are essentially adversarial - trick questions, or ones with no correct answer to see if the model will guess or respond oddly. Another interesting benchmark is SWAG / HellaSWAG, which target commonsense reasoning with adversarial wrong answers that look right. These have been around since before GPT-3 and are largely solved by big models now (GPT-4 exceeds human performance on HellaSWAG), but they were early adversarial datasets showing how subtle wording can trip up AI. Now, researchers escalate to multi-turn adversarial interactions (e.g., someone tries to get the AI to contradict itself or reveal private info over a long chat).\n\nA critical challenge in robustness evaluation is that the space of adversarial inputs is infinite. One can always design a weirder or more convoluted input. Thus, evaluation here is often about known classes of adversarial attacks. For instance, character-level perturbations, prompt injections, logic flips, context pollution (inserting misleading context before a question), etc. The AdvBench we mentioned explicitly tests one known attack (adversarial suffixes). If a model passes that, attackers will try a new method. This cat-and-mouse nature means evaluation must be continuously updated with new adversarial examples as they are discovered.\n\nDespite these difficulties, showing that a model is robust to a suite of stress tests increases confidence in its reliability. For example, Anthropic’s Claude was tested on many prompt attacks and found to be harder to jailbreak than GPT-3.5, indicating a higher robustness - but not unbreakable. Evaluation results are often used to compare models: e.g., Model A with advanced fine-tuning might resist typos or adversarial prompts better than Model B. Such differences can be crucial for deployment decisions.\n\nTo make results generalizable, some propose adversarial training evaluation: train a model on adversarial examples and see if it improves (if yes, then the test wasn’t truly fundamental, just data exposure; if no, the issue might be deeper). From an evaluation perspective, one wants benchmarks that reveal fundamental model limitations that aren’t easily patched by a quick fine-tune.\n\nIn conclusion, robustness and adversarial benchmarks ensure we are not just measuring performance in a vacuum, but under more realistic or even worst-case inputs. They provide insight into how a model might fail in practice - e.g., getting confused by malformed input or being manipulated by a bad actor. As LLMs are used in critical applications, these evaluations are as important as measuring raw accuracy.\n\nEfficiency and Cost-Based Trade-offs\n------------------------------------\n\nLarge language models differ not only in quality of outputs but also in computational efficiency, inference speed, and cost. Evaluating an LLM’s “performance” thus isn’t just about accuracy or safety - practitioners care about throughput (tokens per second), latency (response time), memory footprint, and how these scale with model size or deployment setup. Therefore, modern benchmarking sometimes incorporates efficiency metrics to inform practical trade-offs between model quality and cost.\n\nFor instance, the HELM benchmark explicitly includes efficiency as one of its core metrics, measuring aspects like the inference latency per token and the cost to generate an output for each model. This allows direct comparison of, say, GPT-4 vs a smaller model in terms of how much compute they require to achieve certain results. In real-world scenarios, a slightly lower accuracy might be acceptable if it comes with 10× lower cost.\n\nOpenAI’s own reports highlight this trade-off: GPT-4’s superior capability comes with a much larger computational cost. It’s estimated to be over 10× more expensive per token to run than the GPT-3.5-Turbo model. An analysis by Microsoft researchers (Chi et al., 2023) showed that GPT-4’s improved coding ability, for example, must be weighed against its price: GPT-4 solved ~68% of coding tasks vs GPT-3.5’s 46%, but at 20× the cost per call. They demonstrated an adaptive approach where one uses GPT-3.5 for easy cases and GPT-4 for hard cases, achieving higher overall accuracy (90% on HumanEval coding benchmark) at ~18% lower cost than using GPT-4 for everything. This sort of work suggests that benchmarks should also consider cost-efficiency - not just can Model X solve the task, but how efficiently in terms of compute or dollars?\n\nHumanEval (the coding benchmark with 164 programming problems) can illustrate this: GPT-4 might get nearly all questions correct if allowed multiple attempts, but a smaller fine-tuned model might achieve say 80% with much faster runtime. If one needs real-time code generation, the latter might be preferable. Therefore, reporting pass rate vs runtime or accuracy vs model size is increasingly common in benchmark studies.\n\nAdditionally, there are benchmarks focusing on model compression and distillation effects - e.g., does an 13B parameter model fine-tuned on instructions perform as well as a 175B model on certain tasks? If yes, that’s a win for efficiency. The rise of open models like LLaMA-2 and Mistral (7B) has spurred interest in evaluation under resource constraints. Some papers explicitly chart accuracy vs model size on benchmarks like MMLU or truthfulness, to see if smaller models can punch above their weight.\n\nAnother aspect is memory robustness: e.g., how does the model’s performance degrade if you use 4-bit quantization to save memory? There’s now testing that a quantized model still retains high accuracy on benchmarks, which is crucial for edge deployment.\n\nIn the academic sense, efficiency metrics have to be interpreted carefully because they depend on hardware and implementation. One model might seem faster simply due to better optimized code. To mitigate that, some benchmark frameworks fix the environment or use tokens generated as a proxy. HELM reports “prompt throughput” for models on a standardized setup, giving a rough idea of relative speed.\n\nIn summary, while efficiency and cost are not benchmarks in the traditional sense of question-answer accuracy, they are increasingly reported alongside benchmark results. The trade-offs between capability and cost mean that evaluation is multi-objective. For researchers, a big open question is how to fairly compare models when one is twice as good but ten times slower - the answer depends on use case. At the very least, transparency in these metrics is encouraged. Evaluation suites of the future may even assign a combined score that penalizes very slow models or reward models that achieve high performance with fewer resources, reflecting a real-world utility function rather than pure accuracy.\n\nTool Use and Coding Abilities\n-----------------------------\n\nAs large language models become integrated into complex systems, their ability to use tools (like calling APIs, running code, or searching the web) is increasingly relevant. Additionally, many LLMs are trained or tuned for code generation, making programming benchmarks a key part of evaluation. We consider these related, since using tools often implies generating or understanding structured formats (code, APIs, queries).\n\nCode generation benchmarks have become standard after OpenAI’s Codex and similar models. The most famous is HumanEval, a set of 164 Python programming problems where an LLM must generate a correct solution function for each prompt (with correctness measured by running hidden test cases). On HumanEval, state-of-the-art models reach very high pass rates - for example, GPT-4 (2023) was reported to solve ~80% or more of the problems with few attempts, and one specialized model “AutoCoder” even claimed a 90.9% pass@1, slightly above GPT-4 Turbo’s 90.2%. These numbers indicate near-human or above-human programming ability on short coding tasks. However, HumanEval has been around for a while, and top models now approach saturation on it. Researchers have introduced harder coding challenges like the MBPP (Mostly Basic Programming Problems) and LeetCode puzzles, as well as multi-step coding benchmarks (writing an entire program for a more complex spec, possibly requiring multiple functions or reasoning). There’s also the APPS dataset with thousands of coding problems ranging from easy to competition-level difficulty. GPT-4 excels at easy and medium, but still struggles on the very hardest competitive programming problems, so there’s headroom in code evaluation.\n\nWhen it comes to tool use, one way to evaluate is via simulation tasks. For example, an LLM might be placed in a setting where it has access to a calculator or a database, and the benchmark asks questions that require using that tool (because no human could do it mentally either). An instance could be a math word problem whose arithmetic is too large to do in one’s head - the model should learn to invoke the calculator tool. If the model just tries to solve it directly and makes a mistake, it fails. OpenAI’s WebGPT and DeepMind’s Toolformer research have such evaluations internally, but as of now there isn’t a widely adopted public “tool-use benchmark suite.” Instead, researchers often create custom evals: e.g., give the model a web browser and test it on factual questions that require looking up current information. Success is measured by whether it actually uses the browse tool and finds the correct info.\n\nA notable effort here is the OpenAI Evals framework, which lets users write evaluations where the model can call functions (tool APIs) and you verify the outcome. This has enabled the community to contribute scenarios like “Given a latitude/longitude, use a geocoding API to find the city” and see if a model integrated with tools does so correctly. Although not a single benchmark, these frameworks hint at what tool-use evaluation will look like: a collection of scenarios testing the model’s decision to use a tool, the correctness of tool inputs, and handling the outputs.\n\nFor coding, beyond generating correct code, newer benchmarks examine code understanding and debugging. For example, given a piece of code and a bug report, can the LLM fix the bug? Or can it explain what a given code snippet does (an aspect of program comprehension)? Some academic benchmarks (like the CSFG from DeepMind) tackle these, but they’re less common than generation tasks.\n\nAn interesting intersection is when an LLM needs to produce code as a tool to solve a problem. For instance, GSM8K (a math word problem dataset) often is easier for a model if it can write a short piece of code to compute the answer. If an eval environment allowed that, it would test multi-step reasoning with code as a tool.\n\nLastly, an emerging evaluation for tool use is in agent simulations. One example: set up a virtual environment (like a text-based game or a web navigation task) and see if the LLM can plan and execute a sequence of tool calls to achieve a goal. Success criteria are things like: did it book a flight using a flight-search API given a high-level request? These are not yet standardized benchmarks but are active research (for instance, the LLM-as-agent research often reports success rates on such tasks).\n\nIn summary, evaluation of tool use and coding extends the scope of LLM benchmarking beyond pure language output to how well models interface with external systems. Challenges in designing these evaluations include: defining clear success metrics (since it’s not just one answer but a sequence of actions that matter), and the combinatorial complexity of tasks (an agent might succeed partially). Nevertheless, coding benchmarks like HumanEval provide a strong quantitative anchor (pass rate) that correlates well with real utility (developers using LLMs to generate code). And as LLMs become parts of larger pipelines, their proficiency in wielding tools will be increasingly scrutinized through such targeted evaluations.\n\nInstruction Following and General-Purpose Capabilities\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the hallmark advancements of recent LLMs is their ability to follow instructions and act as general-purpose conversational agents. This is largely thanks to fine-tuning methods like supervised instruction tuning and RLHF. Evaluating how well a model follows instructions, carries out conversations, and satisfies user intent is more subjective than, say, solving a math problem. Nonetheless, benchmarks and comparative evaluations have been developed to quantify these general-purpose capabilities.\n\nAnthropic introduced the notion of “helpful, honest, and harmless” (HHH) as goals for an AI assistant, and their evaluation involves human raters comparing two model responses for a given prompt. The HHH dataset (open-sourced as part of Anthropic’s work) contains pairwise comparisons. A model that consistently produces responses that humans rate as more helpful (useful, on-topic, thorough), honest (truthful and transparent about uncertainty), and harmless (inoffensive and refusing unethical requests) will score better. This kind of evaluation was used to train Claude and other assistants; as a benchmark, it’s essentially asking: what percentage of the time do humans prefer model A’s output over model B’s, in a wide variety of scenarios? A challenge here is that it’s not automated - it relies on human preference judgments. However, these judgments can be distilled into a model-based “reward model” for faster comparisons.\n\nEnter MT-Bench (Multi-Turn Benchmark), introduced by UC Berkeley’s LMSys team (creators of Vicuna) as part of studying LLM-vs-LLM evaluations. MT-Bench is a set of open-ended questions specifically designed to test an AI assistant’s ability in multi-turn dialogues and instruction following. For example, a question might be: “Explain the pros and cons of renewable energy in the style of a casual conversation, then answer a follow-up question about solar power incentives.” The model’s conversation is evaluated across aspects like coherence, informativeness, following the user’s instructions (style requests, content requests), and possibly creativity. Because scoring such open-ended answers is difficult, the researchers leveraged GPT-4 as an automated judge. They found that GPT-4 as a judging model could match human evaluation of chat quality with about 80% agreement - essentially as good as the agreement between two human evaluators. With GPT-4 as a referee, they compared various chatbots on MT-Bench. This is notable because it’s a new paradigm: using a very advanced model to evaluate other models on general conversation tasks.\n\nThe LMSys team also ran Chatbot Arena, an online platform where humans could chat with two anonymous models side by side and vote for the better response. Data from thousands of such battles formed a human preference dataset for model chat performance. It revealed interesting insights: some models that are nearly identical on knowledge benchmarks (like LLaMA vs fine-tuned Alpaca) have vastly different user preference ratings because alignment and style matter a lot. For example, a base LLaMA-13B might solve trivia as well as an aligned Vicuna-13B on MMLU questions, but in a conversation Vicuna is far more preferred. This underscores that instruction-following ability is not captured by standard academic benchmarks. Therefore, new benchmarks intentionally include open-ended tasks: summarization, creative writing, roleplay, step-by-step assistance, etc., and rely on either human or proxy-humanness evaluation.\n\nAnother general capability is long-horizon coherence. Can the model carry information or follow instructions consistently over a lengthy dialogue or a long document? There aren’t standard tests for this yet beyond some anecdotal setups (like giving the model a 5,000-word story to summarize or asking it not to forget a detail 20 turns later). However, as context window lengths increase (e.g., GPT-4 can take thousands of tokens), we can expect benchmarks that stress test this (perhaps something like: given a long conversation transcript, does the model correctly answer questions about earlier parts, or maintain character consistency).\n\nGeneral-purpose ability also means being able to handle a wide variety of tasks without specialized tuning. The BIG-Bench suite was originally motivated by this - to throw many unusual tasks at a model and see if it can handle them with few-shot prompting. So one way to gauge a model’s general capability is simply how many tasks (across all the above categories) it can perform at a high level. For instance, the Helm project found that models like GPT-4 and Claude excel “across the board” relative to older models, whereas smaller models might be good at some tasks but fail badly at others. Frontier models are expected to demonstrate not just one skill but an array: reasoning + coding + multilingual + etc., which is why integrated benchmarks are needed.\n\nInstruction-following can be evaluated in a straightforward way too: by checking if the model’s output obeys specific instructions about format, style, or content. For example, if instructed “Give me three bullet points about topic X”, does it actually produce three bullet points? If told not to mention a certain word, does it comply? Such fine-grained instruction adherence might be part of some evaluations (and is often tested during model development by unit-tests on prompts).\n\nTo sum up, evaluating general-purpose, instruction-following behavior often involves comparative evaluations (which model gives better responses to a variety of prompts) and composite benchmarks (covering multiple skills in realistic user queries). It brings in subjective criteria like usefulness and user satisfaction. The community has started to automate these evaluations with strong reference models (GPT-4 judges, reward models trained on human feedback), but this raises its own questions - are we aligning models to the preferences of another model? We’ll discuss that next. Nonetheless, from a capabilities standpoint, the trend is towards holistic, scenario-driven evaluation: for example, the recent HolisticEval approach suggests evaluating a model on an end-to-end scenario (like playing the role of a helpful travel assistant) and measuring various outcomes. This is less tidy than a single metric benchmark, but arguably closer to real-world performance.\n\nIntegrated Benchmark Suites and Frontier Model Evaluation\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn light of the above categories, researchers have created benchmark suites that compile many tests to give a comprehensive picture of an LLM. We’ve already mentioned HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models), which is one of the most ambitious efforts. HELM defines a broad set of scenarios (use cases like summarization, QA, dialogue, etc.) and metrics (accuracy, robustness, calibration, bias, toxicity, efficiency, etc.), and evaluates each model on each scenario-metric pair. In its latest report, HELM evaluated 30 prominent models (open and closed) on 42 scenarios, many of which were novel additions not used in previous benchmarks. By standardizing conditions, HELM allows apples-to-apples comparisons and explicitly highlights trade-offs: for example, one model might score highest on accuracy but also higher on toxicity than another. Such suites underscore that no single score or leaderboard tells the full story - you need a vector of metrics.\n\nAnother major suite is BIG-bench (and BIG-bench Hard), which we covered; it’s less about metrics and more about collecting tasks. Similarly, the LMSys Chatbot Arena + MT-Bench combo is becoming a de-facto evaluation for chat models, combining quantitative and qualitative judgments. There is also Stanford’s AlpacaEval and OpenAI’s evals which allow crowdsourced benchmark writing, leading to hundreds of small evals (like “identify the emotion in this sentence” or “is this arithmetic correct”) that can be aggregated.\n\nFor frontier models specifically (GPT-4, Claude 2, PaLM 2, LLaMA-2, etc.), new evaluations attempt to capture emergent behaviors and risks. One example is the work on emergent tool use - testing if a model like GPT-4 can perform tasks that were not explicitly trained, such as doing chemistry reasoning or theory-of-mind puzzles, which earlier models could not. These often appear as isolated research findings rather than standardized benchmarks. But some have been formalized: e.g., ARC-Advanced (a subset of the AI2 Reasoning Challenge) was used to show emergent jump in performance around certain model scales. That became a way to say “does model A have this emergent ability that only shows up beyond X parameters?”\n\nGeneralizing evaluation results is another concern addressed by integrated suites. For instance, HELM documented that before its effort, most models were each evaluated on disjoint sets of benchmarks, making it hard to compare. HELM managed to evaluate every model on 96% of the same core scenarios, so now one can see a more unified picture. It surfaced findings like “Model X is best for summarization, Model Y for code, etc.”. As frontier models keep being released, having a living benchmark that adds new tasks (like MMLU-Pro when MMLU saturates, or new safety tests when new risks are found) is crucial.\n\nHELM Safety, mentioned earlier, is one example where a suite is updated with standardized categories of safety tests. Another is DecodingTrust which bundles multiple trust-related benchmarks into one framework. These integrated evaluations aim to be one-stop shops to evaluate an LLM’s trustworthiness across toxicity, bias, privacy, etc., rather than running 10 separate benchmarks. The authors of DecodingTrust argue it’s “one of the most holistic benchmarks available” for LLM trustworthiness.\n\nWe should also note OpenAI’s internal evals (some details were mentioned in the GPT-4 technical report). OpenAI used over 50 experts in various domains to adversarially test GPT-4 before release. They essentially created custom evaluations in areas like cybersecurity, bioethics, etc., that are not traditional NLP benchmarks at all. While these are not public, they indicate that frontier evaluation often involves expert review and scenario analysis beyond automated benchmarks. For example, testing if GPT-4 can produce dangerous chemical recipes required a chemist to evaluate the outputs.\n\nFinally, leaderboards and competitions are also part of the evaluation ecosystem. The HuggingFace Open LLM leaderboard evaluates models on a mix of benchmarks and ranks them (though this is a moving target as new models flood in). There are also regular challenges (like the GH Challenge for LLMs or Eval4NLP competitions) which introduce new task evaluations. All these contribute to keeping evaluation up-to-date as models evolve.\n\nIn conclusion, integrated benchmark suites provide a broad assessment and help identify gaps - for example, a model might be top-notch in math and code but weak in say commonsense ethics, which a holistic suite would reveal so it can be addressed. As we next discuss, however, there remain many open problems in benchmarking that researchers are actively grappling with, especially as models become more capable and more integrated into real-world settings.\n\nOpen Challenges in LLM Benchmarking\n-----------------------------------\n\nEven with the extensive benchmarks and evaluations described, benchmarking LLMs remains a moving target. Here we outline key open problems and challenges in designing, interpreting, and generalizing LLM evaluations:\n\n*   Model Transparency and Unknown Strategies: Unlike a human test-taker, an LLM’s reasoning process is a black box. A model might get high scores on a benchmark by exploiting spurious patterns or shortcuts rather than truly solving the task. For example, choosing the correct multiple-choice answer without understanding the question (by elimination or dataset bias) could inflate performance. Evaluators often cannot tell if a correct answer was due to genuine reasoning or a “cheat” the model found. This lack of transparency makes it hard to design benchmarks that truly probe intended skills. It also means evaluation should go beyond final answers - looking at chain-of-thought outputs or asking models to explain their reasoning as part of the test could help, but scoring those explanations is non-trivial.\n*   Evolving Capabilities and Saturation: The rapid progress in LLM capabilities means benchmarks can become obsolete or too easy much faster than traditional benchmarks did. We saw this with MMLU saturating in barely a year. As soon as a benchmark becomes a standard target, models may get fine-tuned or engineered to excel at it, yielding clustered high scores that reveal little. New benchmarks like MMLU-Pro arise, but they too might saturate in time. This evolutionary pressure requires constantly creating new challenges - a daunting task. Moreover, a benchmark might not remain predictive of real-world performance once models have essentially solved it. For instance, by 2024 many models score ~90% on SuperGLUE, which once indicated human-level language understanding; yet clearly there were other shortcomings in those models not captured by SuperGLUE. Benchmark lifespan is short, and we need methods (perhaps procedurally generated benchmarks or dynamic adversarial benchmarking) to keep evaluation challenging and relevant over time.\n*   Subjective Metrics and Human Alignment: Many important aspects of LLM behavior - helpfulness, coherence, creativity, ethical stance - are subjective qualities that are hard to boil down to a single automated metric. Human evaluations (ratings, pairwise comparisons) remain the gold standard for these. But humans are inconsistent; even on the same outputs, different people may disagree (studies show ~20% disagreement is common in preference labeling ). This raises questions: How to design evaluation prompts and instructions to get consistent human judgments? How to aggregate them fairly? Additionally, if we use surrogate metrics like “GPT-4 judged this answer a 8/10 for helpfulness”, we risk aligning to the idiosyncrasies of the AI judge. Ensuring that evaluation aligns with actual end-user preferences (which can vary by culture, context, individual) is an unsolved problem. There’s ongoing research into better human-feedback models, but any static benchmark for “write a good essay” or “be a helpful assistant” will always have an irreducible subjective component.\n*   Evaluator Alignment (Human vs. AI Judges): Following from the above - the practice of using LLMs as judges (e.g., GPT-4 scoring chat responses) is promising for scalability, but introduces concerns. LLM judges might have biases: one study found GPT-4 had position bias (favoring whichever answer it saw last in a comparison) and verbosity bias (mistaking longer answers as better). It might also be vulnerable to self-enhancement bias (where a model subtly praises responses more similar to its own style). If not carefully mitigated, these biases could skew evaluation results. Furthermore, an AI judge may not fully grasp human preferences in certain nuanced areas like humor or emotional sensitivity. Researchers are working on calibrating AI evaluators and even using fine-tuned smaller judges (to reduce cost), but verifying that AI evaluators agree with humans on what “better” means is essential. In the long run, a combination of human and AI in the evaluation loop might be needed, especially for high-stakes assessments.\n*   Interactive and Long-Horizon Tasks: Current benchmarks mostly consist of single-turn or independent examples. Yet real deployments often involve interactive sequences - multi-turn dialogues, iterative problem solving, continuous decision making. Evaluating an AI agent over a long horizon (many turns/actions) is challenging because the space of possible interactions is huge. There’s no simple dataset of “100-step conversations” with ground-truth answers. Instead, one might evaluate an agent in a simulated environment or via real user studies. This is time-consuming and hard to standardize. How do we score an AI that plans a 10-step solution to accomplish a goal? One proposal is to use simulation environments (like text games or web navigation) where there’s a clear success condition and let the model loose - success rate can then be measured. But building a suite of such environments that are general enough is tough. Another aspect is memory and consistency in long conversations: models can contradict themselves or forget earlier context. Developing metrics for conversation consistency or for the ability to “self-correct” over a dialogue is an open area. In summary, we need benchmarks that go beyond one-and-done Q&A and test sustained performance, but designing them is an ongoing research project.\n*   Static Benchmarks vs. Real-World Deployment: Perhaps the most fundamental tension is that benchmarks are static, but real-world tasks are dynamic. Once a benchmark is published, models can train on it (or on data very similar to it). In the real world, users can ask anything, and the distribution of queries evolves. There’s also an element of metagaming - optimizing for benchmarks can lead to overfitting to them, at the expense of generality. A model might output exactly what benchmarks expect (to get a high score), but in deployment that could appear overly formulaic or miss the user’s intent. For instance, a model might learn to always give three bullet points on a certain evaluation prompt because that’s what the metric rewards, even if the user didn’t need three. To mitigate this, researchers are exploring adaptive or online evaluation, where the model is evaluated on live user interactions or continuously updated tasks. However, that poses problems for fair comparison (Model A and B might get different queries). Another idea is benchmarking by monitoring: measuring a model’s performance on some real-world tasks (like acceptance rate of its answers on a forum, or success rate in deployed applications). But such measures are context-specific and hard to generalize.\n*   Data Leakage and Benchmark Security: Ensuring that test data remains truly novel to the model is getting harder. LLMs are often trained on so much public data that there’s a high chance that some test questions (or very similar ones) are somewhere in the training set. For older benchmarks like trivia QA, this was already an issue - models could memorize answers. With even bigger training corpora, it’s plausible that a model saw some MMLU questions verbatim during pretraining from some uploaded resource, even if unintended. There is an active push for benchmark security - keeping test sets private or using generative techniques to create test questions on the fly so models can’t memorize them beforehand. OpenAI’s evals allow for dynamic generation of prompts. This will be increasingly important to truly test generalization rather than recollection. It also connects to transparency: closed models might claim a score, but without knowing their training data, we can’t be sure they didn’t have an unfair advantage.\n\nEach of these challenges suggests that benchmarking is not a one-time task but an evolving process. As LLMs become more capable, our methods of evaluation must become more sophisticated, combining static and dynamic tests, human and automated judgments, and covering new ground (e.g., multidisciplinary tasks, ethics, interpretability). The community is aware of these issues; for example, the HELM authors explicitly call it a “living benchmark” to be continuously updated. This agility will be key to keeping evaluations relevant and keeping models accountable.\n\nIn conclusion, evaluating large language models is critical for guiding their development and deployment, but it is undeniably complex. By employing a spectrum of benchmarks - from reasoning and knowledge tests, to truthfulness and toxicity checks, to multilingual and bias assessments, to robustness and efficiency metrics - researchers can build a holistic picture of an LLM’s performance and limitations. Recent benchmark suites like MMLU, BIG-bench, TruthfulQA, ToxiGen, MT-Bench, and HELM have driven the field forward, each illuminating different facets. Yet, designing these benchmarks and interpreting their results requires care: one must consider what each score means, how it was obtained, and what might be missing. As we push into the frontier of GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and beyond, new evaluation techniques (dynamic adversarial testing, AI-as-a-judge, interactive simulations) are being explored to capture frontier behaviors. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that as AI models get more powerful, we also improve our yardsticks for measuring quality, safety, and alignment - so that we not only build more capable AI, but also more trustworthy and understood AI. Each open challenge in benchmarking is an opportunity for the community to innovate in how we assess and steer these rapidly evolving models.\n\nResources\n---------\n\n*   [Liang, P. et al. (2022).

[Final thoughts: Where LLMs go from here](https://www.turing.com/resources/top-llm-trends#final-thoughts-where-llms-go-from-here)  \n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have quickly moved from research labs to mainstream business applications. In 2024, OpenAI’s ChatGPT hit over 200 million monthly users. At the same time, new models emerged with stronger capabilities in language, vision, reasoning, and real-time interaction.\n\nThe global market for LLMs is growing fast – valued at $6.4 billion in 2024, it’s expected to reach $36.1 billion by 2030. Enterprises across finance, healthcare, law, and tech are adopting LLMs to improve automation, insights, and customer experience.\n\nIn 2025, the focus has shifted: from general-purpose LLMs to models tailored for specific industries and tasks. From simple assistants to [autonomous agents](https://www.turing.com/resources/ai-agentic-workflows) that act on our behalf. This article explores what happened in 2024, and what to expect in the future of LLMs.\n\nLLMs in 2024: A year of practical breakthroughs\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Smaller models, broader reach**In 2024, LLM developers focused on making models smaller and more efficient. Models like [TinyGPT](https://github.com/isaacperez/tinygpt)and [TinyGPT-V](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16862) showed that performance doesn’t always require massive size. These models can run with just 8GB of memory, making them easier to use in mobile apps, low-power devices, or places with limited internet access.\n*   **Multimodal AI went mainstream**The launch of GPT-4o by OpenAI marked a major step. It can understand and respond using text, images, and audio in real time. Similar models from Google (Gemini 2.0), Meta (LLaMA 3.2), and Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) followed, expanding AI’s role in creative tools, accessibility, and customer service.\n*   **Better explainability and growing regulation**Tools like SHAP, LIME, and attention visualization gained traction to help users understand how LLMs make decisions. This is critical in industries like healthcare and finance. In parallel, governments moved forward with regulation. The EU AI Act took effect in August 2024, with full rollout planned through 2026.\n*   **New fine-tuning techniques**\n\nPrompt tuning and hybrid methods helped teams customize models without retraining them entirely. AutoML made fine-tuning more accessible, automating decisions like hyperparameter selection. These updates made it faster and cheaper to get LLMs production-ready.\n*   **Open-source innovation**\n\nOpen LLMs gained ground. Models like Mistral, DeepSeek-V3, and LLaMA 3.2 were made publicly available with strong performance. This gave developers more control and flexibility—helping more companies build custom applications.\n*   **Rising focus on ethics and bias**\n\nLLMs continued to face challenges with bias in outputs. In 2024, [Google\'s AI tool Gemini](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/08/we-definitely-messed-up-why-did-google-ai-tool-make-offensive-historical-images) faced backlash for generating historically inaccurate images, such as depicting World War II soldiers as people of color in contexts where this was not historically accurate. The incident highlighted the challenges AI faces in balancing diversity with historical accuracy.\n\nResearchers worked to identify causes like skewed training data or model behavior and developed mitigation techniques. [Ethical AI](https://www.turing.com/resources/implementing-security-guardrails-for-llms) became a shared responsibility across developers, researchers, and policymakers.\n\nTop LLM trends in 2025\n----------------------\n\n*   **Smaller, more efficient models**The push for compact models continues. [TinyLlama](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02385)(1.1B parameters) and [Mixtral 8x7B](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04088)(47B parameters, 13B active per token) are early examples. These models reduce computational costs while maintaining strong performance, making LLMs more accessible for education, mobile apps, and startups.\n\nSparse expert models are gaining momentum too. Instead of activating the entire network, they use only parts relevant to the task—improving speed and energy efficiency.\n*   **Real-time fact-checking and external data access**LLMs are getting better at integrating live data. Tools like Microsoft Copilot use real-time internet access to validate answers. This helps [reduce hallucinations](https://www.turing.com/resources/minimize-llm-hallucinations-strategy) and brings model responses closer to how humans cross-check facts.\n\nFuture models will include references and citations by default, raising the bar for accuracy and transparency.\n*   **Synthetic training data**Some LLMs can now generate their own training data. For example, Google’s self-improving model created questions and answers to improve itself—boosting test scores significantly. This technique could reduce the cost and time of data collection and improve performance in niche domains.\n*   **Enterprise integration**LLMs are becoming part of daily business operations. Salesforce’s Einstein Copilot uses LLMs to support customer service, sales, and marketing. GitHub Copilot helps developers write and debug code. These integrations improve productivity and reduce manual work.\n\nAs APIs and [fine-tuning](https://www.turing.com/resources/finetuning-large-language-models) become more accessible, expect to see LLMs embedded across industries—from insurance claims to HR workflows.\n*   **Domain-specific LLMs**Instead of one-size-fits-all, 2025 is moving toward models trained for specific fields. BloombergGPT focuses on finance. Med-PaLM is trained on medical data. ChatLAW supports legal applications in China.\n\nThese models deliver better accuracy and fewer errors because they understand the context of their domain more deeply.\n*   **Multimodal capabilities**Future models are no longer limited to text. [Multimodal LLMs](https://www.turing.com/resources/multimodal-llms) can handle text, image, audio, and even video. This allows new use cases—like analyzing X-rays, generating music, or understanding a video scene and answering questions about it.\n\nCross-language support is also improving, enabling global collaboration and content creation without translation barriers.\n*   **Autonomous agents**One of the biggest trends in 2025 is [agentic AI](https://www.turing.com/resources/how-to-build-an-ai-agent). These are LLM-powered systems that can make decisions, interact with tools, and take actions—without constant human input.\n\nOpenAI’s o1 model, for example, is designed for chain-of-thought reasoning. Combined with memory and planning tools, these agents can schedule meetings, analyze reports, or manage workflows.\n\nBy 2028, Gartner predicts that 33% of enterprise apps will include autonomous agents, enabling 15% of work decisions to be made automatically.\n*   **Safety, alignment, and bias mitigation**As LLMs gain more control in business and society, safety is critical. In 2024, researchers began evaluating models for behaviors like in-context deception or bias under pressure. In 2025, more attention is going toward robust oversight, transparency, and responsible AI practices.\n\nCompanies are adopting RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), fairness-aware training, and external audits to reduce risks.\n*   **Security and risk management**[Security risks](https://www.turing.com/resources/implementing-llms-with-a-security-first-approach) are also on the rise. OWASP’s updated Top 10 for LLMs highlights concerns like system prompt leakage, excessive memory use, and malicious prompt injection. As AI becomes more autonomous, these risks need constant monitoring.\n\nDevelopers are building safeguards into models, such as sandboxed environments, output filters, and red teaming exercises.\n*   **Market momentum and economic impact**LLMs aren’t just a tech story—they’re reshaping the economy. Goldman Sachs estimates generative AI could lift global GDP by 7% in the next decade. New industries are forming around AI tooling, infrastructure, and education.\n\nVenture capital is flowing into AI startups at record rates, with a focus on efficient, open, and customizable models.\n\nTop LLM research papers in 2025\n-------------------------------\n\n*   [Improving the Efficiency of Test-Time Search in LLMs with Backtracking](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=hJ2BCYGvFg)\n\n[****](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=hJ2BCYGvFg)A new technique leveraging process reward models (PRMs) and in-context process supervision to refine multi-step reasoning efficiency by identifying and revising flawed steps in LLM reasoning\u200b.\n*   [SWE-Lancer: Can AI Earn $1M in Freelance Software Engineering?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12115)\n\n_[](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12115)_ SWE-Lancer benchmarked LLMs on 1,400+ freelance coding tasks from Upwork, testing real-world debugging, feature building, and code review.

Interestingly, it outperformed the actual human participant in the same evaluation. Meta’s LLaMA-3.1 also scored close to human levels, while models like GPT-4o and ELIZA fell well short. This provides the first strong empirical evidence that modern LLMs can reliably pass the original Turing test, sparking important conversations about how we define intelligence, authenticity, and human-like behavior in AI systems.\n\nFinal thoughts: Where LLMs go from here\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe future of LLMs in 2025 is not just about better answers; it’s about better decisions, better workflows, and better outcomes. Whether it\'s automating a routine task, creating new art, or powering scientific research, LLMs are becoming tools that shape how we work and live.\n\nFrom compact models and domain-specific AI to autonomous agents and real-time data access, we’re seeing the next phase of evolution take shape. The big question is no longer if LLMs will change your business, but how, when, and how safely.\n\nOne trend has become clear: progress in AGI won’t come from model size alone. It will come from better data, more grounded evaluation, and smarter infrastructure. We’ve seen LLMs pass the Turing test, agents learn by sharing skills, and multimodal models tackle emotional reasoning. But these leaps are powered by what happens behind the scenes: carefully calibrated benchmarks, human-verified supervision, and domain-specific training pipelines.\n\nAs we look ahead, the next generation of AGI systems will need to reason across modalities, adapt in real time, and align with human intent—not just through clever algorithms, but through the hard, human work of crafting meaningful tasks, curating thoughtful data, and asking the right questions.\n\nAt Turing, we help organizations stay ahead of this evolution.
